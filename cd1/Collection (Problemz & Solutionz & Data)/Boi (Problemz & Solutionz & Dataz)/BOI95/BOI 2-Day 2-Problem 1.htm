<P align=center><BR><BR>Assume an nxn table (where n&lt;=10) containing positive 
integer numbers 1 &lt; x &lt;="40." <BR></P>
<OL type=i>
  <LI>
  <P align=center>(30 points) Replace each number x with a number y, where y is 
  the maximum number of prime numbers which sum to x, so that any prime number 
  appears once in the sum with at most one and only one exception of a prime 
  number which may appear twice. Have, also, in mind that 1 is not prime. For 
  example: </P>

  <P>Give the resulting table in the output. <BR><BR></P>
  <LI>(10 points) After each element x has been replaced with y, determine the 
  maximal number of y elements which are connected horizontally, vertically or 
  diagonally forming a concrete area, and give this y value. Also, determine, 
  the smallest enclosing rectangle which can be defined by giving the 
  coordinates (i.e. row and column) of the upper leftmost and lower rightmost 
  corners of the enclosing rectangle. <BR><BR>
  <LI>(25 points) In general, the area found in (ii) is not a square or even a 
  rectangle. Determine the minimum number of non-overlapping squares of any size 
  (e.g. 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, etc.) it consists of. <BR><BR>
  <LI>(20 points) Try to maximize the area determined in (ii) with the minimum 
  number of element swappings of the table produce in question (i). Give, also, 
  the coordinates of the elements which are swapped. Show in the output the new 
  form of the table obtained. <BR><BR>
  <LI>(15 points) Determine the y element that appears most often in the table 
  produced in question (i). In case of a tie (e.g. two or more y elements with 
  the same value) choose the y element with the smallest value. Try to collect 
  all its instances nearby (i.e. so that the are connected horizontally, 
  vertically or diagonally) and give the minimum number of swappings performed. 
  Give, also, the coordinates of the elements which are swapped. Illustrate the 
  new form of the table obtained. Beware that the swappings should be applied on 
  the table produced in question (i). </LI></OL>

          <LI>The output should be given in three separate lines as follows: 
          <BR>11 <BR>4 <BR>(1,2),(4,5) <BR>where the first line gives the 
          maximal number of y connected elements, the second line contains the y 
          value, and the third line contains the coordinates of the enclosing 
          rectangle. <BR><B>HINT:</B>you may avoid the parentheses and give the 
          coordinates separated by commas. The same hint holds for the output of 
          question (iv) and (v). 
          <LI>The output consists of a single number: <BR>8 <BR>which stands for 
          the minimum number of non-overlapping square in the area of (ii).

          <BR>6 2 6 2 2 5 <BR>where the first line gives the minimum number of 
          swappings, and the second line gives the coordinates of the swapped 
          element(s). The next n lines contain the new form of the table. <BR>

          stands for the most often appearing element, the second line for the 
          minimum number of swappings, the next lines give the coordinates of 
          the two swappings. Finally, the last n lines illustrate the new form
