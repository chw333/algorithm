<H2 align=center>Day 1 - Problem 2 (40 points) </H2>
<P align=center><BR><BR>Computer networking requires that the computers in the 
network be linked. This problem considers a linear network in which the 
computers are chained together so that each one is connected to exactly two 
others except for the two computers on the ends of the chain which are connected 
to only one computer. In the picture shown below, the computers are the black 
dots and their locations in the network are identified by planar coordinates 
(relative to a coordinate system not shown in the picture). <BR><BR><IMG

various reasons it is desirable to minimize the length of the cable used. The 
problem is to determine how the computers should be connected in such a chain to 
minimize the total length of cable needed. In the installation being 
constructed, the cable will run beneath the floor, so that the amount of cable 
used to join 2 successive computers will be equal to the distance between the 
computers plus 10 additional meters of cable to connect from the floor to the 
computers and provide some slack for ease of installation. <BR></P>

        <P align=center><B>Input</B>: <BR>The input file will represent a data 
        set beginning with a line consisting of a single number indicating the 
        number of computers in the network (at least 2 and at most 10 
        computers). Then, in successive lines the coordinates are given as pairs 
        of integer numbers (in the range [0..100]) separated by one or more 
        space, e.g. <BR>5 <BR>8 11 <BR>8 16 <BR>12 16 <BR>13 8 <BR>24 10 
        <BR><BR>The picture below shows the optimal way of connecting the 
        computers shown above. <BR><BR><IMG height=238

        <LI><B>Output</B>:<BR>The output should consist of n lines, where n is 
        the number of computers. The first line should give the total length of 
        cable needed. Subsequent lines should comprise of three numbers, l, s, e 
        (from: length, start, end). The first number, l, should depict the 
        length of the cable to be cut to connect the two computers, s and e. The 
        values of s and e should represent the order of computers in the input. 
        Any direction for traversing the network from the one end to the other 
        is valid. For example, <BR><BR>66.01 <BR>14 3 2 <BR>15 2 1 <BR>15.83 1 4
