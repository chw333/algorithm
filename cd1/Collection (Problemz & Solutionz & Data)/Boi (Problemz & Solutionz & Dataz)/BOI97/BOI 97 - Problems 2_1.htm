      <P>The street network of a city is composed of streets and nodes. In a 
      node, two or more streets can meet. All streets are one-way streets. Note 
      also that, two nodes can be connected directly by more than one street, 
      and one node can have a street that loops back to itself. Write a computer 
      program in order to address the following issues:</P>
      <P>1. Is it possible to start from at least one node A and visit ALL 
      streets exactly once ?</P>
      <P>2. How many nodes can serve as starting points in order to satisfy the 
      property of the previous case ?</P>
      <P>3. For each node X, how many paths of length S exist starting from X 
      and ending to X, where any street or node can be visited more than once 
      ?</P>
      <P><B><FONT color=yellow>INPUT</FONT></B><BR>Your program should read the 
      input from the file INPUT.TXT as follows: In the first line there is a 
      positive integer number N (N&lt;=50), denoting the number of nodes in the 
      city street network. The second line contains a positive integer number S 
      (S&lt;=3) denoting the path length. The next N lines contain the network 
      description in matrix form. More precisely, the element in row I and 
      column J is the number of streets from node I to node J.</P>
      <P><B><FONT color=yellow>OUTPUT</FONT></B><BR>Your program should generate 
      the output in the file OUTPUT.TXT as follows: The first line contains the 
      string "YES" if you can start from a node, travel through all streets 
      exactly once, and arrive either at the starting point, or at another node. 
      Otherwise, the string "NO" should appear in the output. If the answer is 
      "YES", the next line of the output file should contain a positive integer 
      number denoting how many nodes can serve as starting points. Finally, the 
      last line of the output file should contain N positive integers (separated 
      by a space) that show for each node how many different paths with length S 
      exist such that each path leads from the node back to itself. These 
      numbers should be sorted in increasing order.</P><B><FONT
