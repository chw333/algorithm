<H2 align=center>Day 1 - Problem 1 (Compatible fishes)</H2>
<P align=center><BR><BR>If you want to create an aquarium with exotic fish you 
must take the advise of an expert in order to avoid a situation in which a 
certain type of fish can not coexist and live together with another fish type. 
The reason is the "incompatibility" among fish types. <BR><BR>Given the number 
of fish types and the available amount of money for spending, find the maximum 
number of fish types. For this number of fish types find the maximum amount of 
money that can be spent, provided that only one fish per type is used.

    <TD vAlign=top width="100%"><B>Input:</B> <BR>INPUT DATA (file INPUT.TXT) 
      The program reads input lines from the file INPUT.TXT as follows: <BR>
      <UL>
        <LI>on the first line two integers, separated by a space are given. The 
        first number represents the maximum available amount of money M 
        (M&lt;=1000) for investment and the second one represents the different 
        number of fish types F (F&lt;=30) available. 
        <LI>on F subsequent lines, the identification number of each fish type 
        and the corresponding cost separated by a space, are given. 
        <LI>on subsequent lines until the end of file, the file contains pairs 
        of fish types, separated by space, that represent the incompatibilities 
        among the different fish types (those fish combinations that can not 
        live or coexist together) the end of file is indicated by a line that 
        contains two zeros separated by a single space (0 0). </LI></UL></TD></TR>
