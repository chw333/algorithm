<H2 align=center>Day 2 - Problem 3 (Windows in a graphical user interface)</H2>
<P align=center><BR><BR>A common operation in graphical environments is the 
handling of overlapping windows. Only the exposed portions of a window are 
displayed, with special routines written to determine what portions of a window 
are exposed, and should be dealt with. Your task is to take a list of windows, 
do the appropriate manipulations, and, upon request, indicate the exposed area 
of a given window. <BR><BR><BR></P>

    <TD vAlign=top width="100%"><B>Input:</B> <BR>The program reads the input 
      file INPUT.TXT as a series of one instruction per line in the following 
      format:<BR>w(I,X,Y,x,y) <BR>t(I) <BR>b(I) <BR>e(I) <BR>s(I) <BR>In the 
      above input 'w', 't', 'b', 'e', 's' are the commands manipulating the 
      windows. The rest of the information represent the following data: 
<BR><BR>
      <UL>
        <LI>I is a windows id. The windows identifiers will be single characters 
        in the range: 
        abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789-+ As the 
        identifiers are unique, it will not be possible to have two windows with 
        the same id, open at the same moment. There will be no more than 64 
        windows opened at any one time. 
        <LI>X and Y are the upper left-hand coordinates of the window. 
        <LI>x and y are the lower right-hand coordinates of the window. It is 
        assumed that in order to perform an operation on a given window, this 
        specific window must have been created before with the 'w' command. 
      </LI></UL>
      <P><BR>Explanation of window-commands : <BR><BR></P>
      <UL>
        <LI>'w': creates a window with the appropriate id, size and location. A 
        newly created window is created on top of all existing windows. 
        <LI>'t': brings the indicated window on the top of all other windows. 
        <LI>'e': erases the indicated window from the screen. 
        <LI>'b': puts the indicated window below all other windows. 
        <LI>'s': shows the percentage of indicated window's exposed area, 
        printed as a real number followed by a new line. </LI></UL>

    <TD vAlign=top width="100%"><B>Output:</B> <BR>The output file of the 
      program OUTPUT.TXT will simply be responses to the 's' commands. For each 
      's' command found and processed in the input file, one output line is 
      generated that shows in a percentage the exposed area of the indicated 
      window. <BR><BR></TD></TR>

      will be displayed on will not exceed 250x250. The thickness of windows 
      boundaries is negligible (i.e. w(a,0,4,4,0) is a window of area 16).
