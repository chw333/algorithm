<H2 align=center>Day 2 - Problem 1 (30 points) </H2>
<P align=center><BR><BR>Imagine you are at the social get-together with at most 
500 guests. The host invites you all to have dinner. There are several tables in 
the dining room. The way the guests sit down at the tables is the following: 
each one sitting not alone at a certain table must know at least one person 
sitting at the same table and no one else sitting at other tables. <BR><BR>It is 
supposed that if a person knows a second person, the second one knows the first 
person too. No one introduces himself to the other persons sitting at the same 
table. That means that if two persons are sitting at the same table, but 
initially they do not know each other, they will not know each other afterwards 
either. <BR><BR></P>

    <TD vAlign=top width="100%">Determine how many tables are necessary and 
      the persons sitting at each table (20 points). At each table there is only 
      one person who will talk to the waiter; he/she is called the leader of the 
      table. Each person relays his wishes concerning the menu to the persons he 
      knows. The time allocated to each person to relay his wishes to each 
      person he knows is supposed to be the same for each person. <BR><BR></TD></TR>

    <TD vAlign=top width="100%">Determine the most suitable person as leader 
      of the table in order to receive information from all the persons sitting 
      at the table in the shortest possible period of time; produce at output 
      the leader of each table and the corresponding period of time(20 points). 
      Afterwards, the host wishes to unify tables. For this purpose, he calls 
      some friends. Each of them, when coming, is introduced to the leaders of 
      two tables, links the tables, sits down at the new formed table and 
      becomes the leader of this table. <BR><BR></TD></TR>

    <TD vAlign=top width="100%">What is the order of linking the tables in 
      this way, so that at last all tables unified into a single one and the 
      conditions of the previous point are satisfied? Specify the minimum 
      necessary period of time for the leader to get information from all the 
      other persons. (30 points)<BR>After the complete linking, the friends of 
      the host are leaving and the tables get their initial structure until the 
      end of the dinner. When the dinner is over, the persons start leaving the 
      tables. <BR><BR></TD></TR>
