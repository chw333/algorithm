SO WINNIE-THE-POOH WENT OFF TO FIND EEYORE'S TAIL.

IT WAS A FINE SPRING MORNING IN THE FOREST AS HE STARTED OUT. LITTLE SOFT
CLOUDS PLAYES HAPPILY IN A BLUE SKY, SKIPPING FROM TIME TO TIME
IN FRONT OF THE SUN AS IF THEY HAD COME TO PUT IN OUT, AND THEN SLIDING AWAY
SUDDENLY SO THAT THE NEXT MIGHT HAVE HIS TURN. THROUGH THEM AND BETWEEN
THEM THE SUN SHONE BRAVELY; AND A COPSE WHISCH HAD WORN ITS FIRS ALL THE
YEAR ROUND SEEMED OLD AND DOWDY NOW BESIDE THE NEW GREEN LACE WHICH
THE BEECHES HAD PUT ON SO PRETTILY.
