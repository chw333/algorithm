<h2>
Postman</h2>

(Running time - 1s.)
<p><br>In a countryside a postman has to deliver post to customers that
live in villages and along every road connecting the villages.
<p>Your task is to help the postman design a route that goes though every
village and every road at least once--the input data are such that this
is always possible. However, each route also has a cost. The people in
the villages wish that the postman visit their village as early as possible.
Therefore, each village has made the following deal with the post: If the
village <i>i</i> is visited as the <i>k</i>-th \textbfdifferent village
on the tour and <i>k&lt;=w(i)</i>, the village pays <i>w(i)-k</i> euros
to the post. However, if <i>k>w(i)</i>, the post agrees to pay <i>k-w(i)</i>
euros to the village. Moreover, the post pays the postman one euro for
each road on the tour.
<p>There are <i>n</i> villages, numbered form 1 to <i>n</i>. The post is
located in the village number one, so the route should start and end in
this village. Each village is placed on the crossing of two roads, on the
crossing of four roads, or there is a road going through the village (i.e.
there are 2, 4, or 8 roads going out of each village). There can be several
roads connecting the same villages or a road can be a loop, i.e. connect
a village with itself.
<h2>
Task</h2>
Your task is to write a program that:
<ul>
<li>
reads the description of villages and connecting them roads, from the input
file <tt>pos.in</tt>,</li>

<li>
designs such a route that goes through each village and road at least once
and maximizes the total profit (or minimizes the loss) of the post,</li>

<li>
writes the result to the output file <tt>pos.out</tt>.</li>
</ul>
If there are several possible solutions, your program should output just
one of them.
<h2>
Input</h2>
In the first line of the input file <tt>pos.in</tt>, there are two integers
<i>n</i>
and <i>m</i>, separated by a single space; <i>n</i>, <i>1&lt;=n&lt;=200</i>,
is the number of villages and <i>m</i> is the number of roads. In each
of the following <i>n</i> lines there is one positive integer. The <i>i+1</i>-th
line contains <i>w(i)</i>, <i>1&lt;=w(i)&lt;=1 000</i>, specification of
the fee paid by the village number <i>i</i>. In each of the following <i>m</i>
lines there are two positive integers separated by a single space--villages
connected by consecutive roads.
<h2>
Output</h2>
Your program should write one positive integer <i>k</i>, the length of
the route, to the first line of the output file <tt>pos.out</tt>. The following
line should contain <i>k+1</i> numbers of consecutive villages on the route
<i>v<sub>1</sub>,v<sub>2</sub>,...,v<sub>k+1</sub></i>,
separated by single spaces, with <i>v<sub>1</sub>=v<sub>k+1</sub>=1</i>.
