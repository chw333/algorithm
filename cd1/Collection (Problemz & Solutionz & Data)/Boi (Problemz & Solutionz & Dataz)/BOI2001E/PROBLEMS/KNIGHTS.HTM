<h2>
Knights</h2>

(Running time - 1s.)
<p><br>We are given a chess-board of size <i>n*n</i>, from which some fields
have been removed. The task is to determine the maximum number of knights
that can be placed on the remaining fields of the board in such a way that
none of them check each other.

<br>Fig.1: A knight placed on the field S checks fields marked with x.</center>

<h2>
Task</h2>
Write a program, that:
<ul>
<li>
reads the description of a chess-board with some fields removed, from the
input file <tt>kni.in</tt>,</li>

<li>
determines the maximum number of knights that can be placed on the chess-board
in such a way that none of them check each other,</li>

<li>
writes the result to the output file <tt>kni.out</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Input</h2>
The first line of the input file <tt>kni.in</tt> contains two integers
<i>n</i> and <i>m</i>, separated by a single space, <i>1&lt;=n&lt;=200</i>,
<i>0&lt;=m&lt;n<sup>2</sup></i>; <i>n</i> is the chess-board size and <i>m</i>
is the number of removed fields. Each of the following <i>m</i> lines contains
two integers: <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, separated by a single space, <i>1&lt;=x,y&lt;=n</i>
-- these are the coordinates of the removed fields. The coordinates of
the upper left corner of the board are (1,1), and of the bottom right are
<i>(n,n)</i>. The removed fields are not repeated in the file.
<h2>
Output</h2>
The output file <tt>kni.out</tt> should contain one integer (in the first
and only line of the file). It should be the maximum number of knights
that can be placed on the given chess-board without checking each other.
<h2>
Example</h2>
Input file <tt>kni.in</tt>:
<pre>3 2

1 1

3 3

</pre>
correct output file <tt>kni.out</tt>
