  AN EXAMPLE PROBLEM IS THE ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLE SEQUENCES
  OF CONTINUOUS AND DISCRETE VALUES TOGETHER WITH BACKGROUND
  KNOWLEDGE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE CAN HAVE SENSOR DATA FROM
  VARIOUS PARTS OF AN INDUSTRIAL OR BIOLOGICAL PROCESS,
  TOGETHER WITH TOPOLOGICAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE
  INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT COMPONENTS. THE TASK IS
  TO FIND STRUCTURE FROM THE SET OF SEQUENCES: THE STRUCTURE
  CAN BE LOCAL STRUCTURE, E.G., RULES DESCRIBING
  INTERACTIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT SEQUENCES, OR GLOBAL
  STRUCTURE, E.G., A PROCESS OR REGULATORY NETWORK. THE
  COMPUTATIONAL METHODS USED IN THIS DOMAIN INCLUDE FAST
  ALGORITHMS FOR FINDING PATTERNS, APPROXIMATION TECHNIQUES
  FOR JOINT DENSITIES, AND SEARCH METHODS FOR FINDING THE
  GLOBAL STRUCTURE. SOME SUBPROBLEMS CAN BE FORMULATED AS
  CLASSIFICATION LEARNING TASKS WHERE THE TARGET CONCEPT
  CHANGES IN TIME. NOVEL LEARNING TECHNIQUES (BOOSTING,
  SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES) ARE APPLIED AND FUTHER DEVELOPED
  FOR SOLVING THESE PROBLEMS.

  THE SAME DATA MINING, PATTERN MATCHING, AND MACHINE
  LEARNING APPROACH CAN ALSO BE USED IN THE AREA OF TEXT
  ANALYSIS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE GROUP HAS DEVELOPED METHODS FOR
  FINDING FROM A DOCUMENT COLLECTION ALL MAXIMAL
  SUBSEQUENCES WITH AT LEAST A GIVEN FREQUENCY: THIS
  COLLECTION CAN BE USED AS A CONDENSED CONTENT DESCRIPTOR
  FOR THE DOCUMENT. ANOTHER CURRENT EXAMPLE IN THE AREA OF
  LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGY IS FINDING INTERRELATED STORIES FROM
  DIFFERENT NEWS FEEDS. THE PROBLEM WILL BE ADDRESSED BY
  USING A MULTITUDE OF TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING PATTERN
  DISCOVERY AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES. ONCE THE NEWS
  ARTICLES ARE CLASSIFIED INTO TOPIC CLASSES, THE
  INTERCONNECTED CHAINS OF NEWS ARTICLES CORRESPONDING TO
  EVENT REPORTS CAN BE RECOGNIZED.
