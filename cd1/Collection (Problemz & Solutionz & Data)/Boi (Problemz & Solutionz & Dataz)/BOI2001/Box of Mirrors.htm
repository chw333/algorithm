<P>Mathematician Andris likes different puzzles and one of his favorites is 
covered box of mirrors. If we look at the horizontal cross-section of such a 
box, we can see that its basement contains <I>n*m</I> square cells (<I>n</I> 
rows, and <I>m</I> columns). In each cell there can be placed mirror which is 
oriented diagonally from lower left corner to upper right corner. Both sides of 
the mirror reflect light. At the box edges opposite to each cell row or column 
there is a gap through which you can light a beam into box or the beam can come 
out of the box. Through each gap you can light the beam in only one 
direction--perpendicular to the edge containing the gap. Therefore, beam 
reflecting from mirror changes its direction by 90<SUP>o</SUP>. When the beam 
goes through empty cells, its direction doesn't change. Gaps are numbered 
consecutively from 1 to <I>2*(n+m)</I>, around the box, counter-clockwise, 
starting from the gap on the left side of the upper left cell and going 
downwards. Since arrangement of mirrors in the box is not visible, the only way 
to determine it is by lighting beams in some gaps and watching where light comes 
out. </P><IMG src="Box of Mirrors.files/box2.gif"> 
<H2>Task</H2>
<P>Write program that: 
<UL>
  <LI>reads the size of the box and gaps describing beams coming in and out of 
  the box from the input file <TT>box.in</TT>, 
  <LI>determines in which cells there are mirrors and which cells are empty, 
  <LI>writes the result to the output file <TT>box.out</TT>. </LI></UL>
<P>If there are several possible solutions, your program should output anyone of 
them. 
<H2>Input</H2>
<P>First line of input file <TT>box.in</TT> contains two positive integers: 
<I>n</I> (the number of cells rows, <I>1&lt;=n&lt;=100</I>) and <I>m</I> (the 
number of cells columns, <I>1&lt;=m&lt;=100</I>) separated by a single space. 
Each of the following <I>2*(n+m)</I> lines contains one positive integer. The 
number in the <I>i+1</I>-th line denotes the number of gap from which light 
comes out if it is lightened into gap number <I>i</I>. 
<H2>Output</H2>
<P>Your program should write to the output file <TT>box.out</TT> <I>n</I> lines, 
each of them containing <I>m</I> integers separated by single spaces. The 
<I>j</I>-th number in the <I>i</I>-th line should be 1, if there is a mirror in 
the cell in the <I>i</I>-th row and <I>j</I>-th column of the box, or it should 
be 0 if the cell is empty.
