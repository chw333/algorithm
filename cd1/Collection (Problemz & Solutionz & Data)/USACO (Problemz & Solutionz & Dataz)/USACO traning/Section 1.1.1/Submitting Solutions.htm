<P>The USACO Training Program features an automatic grading system for your 
homework problems. You submit your programs from the problem page itself or via 
e-mail; they are compiled and graded, the results conveyed back to you, often in 
under a minute. 
<P>C/C++ and PASCAL available. This system uses the GNU GCC compilation suite 
for C/C++ programs and the Free Pascal system for Pascal programs. 
<P>The grading system compilers are those that will be used at the IOI. 
<P>These newer compilers uses 32 bit int's; the Borland compilers use 16 bit 
int's. DO NOT GET IN TROUBLE BECAUSE OF THIS! <B>
<P>Everyone should submit solutions via the web. To submit a program from the 
web page, just type in its filename. Be sure to include the ID/PROG headers, but 
do not include <TT>### PROGRAM</TT>/<TT>### END</TT>.</B> 
<HR>
If you absolutely do not wish to use the web, you can submit via e-mail. To 
submit a program via e-mail, use the e-mail interface that is similar to that 
used for USACO programming contests, though with far fewer fields. Basically, 
you insert a line that says `<TT>### PROGRAM</TT>' before your program and a 
line that says `<TT>### END</TT>' after your program. Add some header comments 
and mail in the program. 
<P>The header comments are very simple, just your ID number (your USACO login 
name) and the name of the program (which will be given in each programming 
assignment. Here is a complete example for the `hello world' program written in 
C: <PRE>### PROGRAM
/*
ID: kolstad001
PROG: hello
*/

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

main ()
{
    FILE *out = fopen ("hello.out", "w");
    fprintf(out, "Hello world.\n");
    exit (0);
}
### END
</PRE>And here's the `hello world' program written in Pascal: <PRE>### PROGRAM
{
ID: kolstad001
PROG: hello
}

program hello;
var f: text;
begin
   Assign(f,'hello.out');
   ReWrite(f);
   writeln(f, 'Hello world.');
   close (f);
end.
### END
</PRE>

<P>You can try as many different things (subject to the caveats below) as you 
like to see how the grading system works. Theoretically, you can't break it or 
crash it. If you see a problem, please let me know. 
<P>Programs read and write to file names like `hello.in' and `hello.out'. Each 
program will tell you the proper filenames. This program uses `hello.out' only. 
Filenames are case-sensitive - and pretty much always lower-case for this 
grading system. 
<P>The restrictions are few: 
<UL>
  <LI>Five second runtime limit unless other specified (500 MHz Celeron) 
  <LI>About 16MB datasize limit 
  <LI>About 1MB stacksize limit 
  <LI>Be sure your program exits with status 0 
  <LI>Be sure you print complete lines (with terminating newline), not just a 
  few words or numbers 
  <LI>Don't use files other than the specified input and output files 
  <LI>Other common sense rules that need not be listed </LI></UL>
<P>The rules are simple: 
<UL>
  <LI>Don't try to cheat. 
  <LI><B>Don't just print the answers</B>, you must calculate them in your 
  program. If you just print answers, your login ID will be removed. 
  <LI>Don't try to look at other files on the system or use other schemes to 
  break security 
  <LI>Don't try to break common sense rules of privacy 
  <LI>Please report anomalous behavior to me right away (<A 
  href="mailto:kolstad@ace.delos.com">mailto:kolstad@ace.delos.com</A>) 
  <LI>Have as much fun as possible 
  <LI>Earn a trip to the IOI and other exotic contests! </LI></UL>
<P>Some hints: 
<UL>
  <LI>Both stderr and stdout are returned to you if your program exits properly 
  <LI><B>Feel free to ask questions and send in comments</B> 
  <LI>Your reported output has `_'s substituted for spaces 
  <LI>Include this comment if you use try/catch/throw in C++: 
  <TT>/*pragma&nbsp;handle-exceptions*/</TT> </LI></UL>
<P>Compiler comments (please send in new compiler comments as you find them): 
<UL>
  <LI>We're using g++ (a.k.a. djgpp on PCs) and Free Pascal 
  <LI>In C/C++, ints are 32 bits (char is 8; short is 16; long is 32; long long 
  is 64) 
  <LI>some libraries have new names; some have different or missing functions 
  <LI>stricmp doesn't exist; use strcmp for string compares 
  <LI>strrev does not exist 
  <LI>neither itoa nor ltoa exists (use sprintf instead) 
  <LI>No need for huge - pointers already go everywhere 
  <LI>Pascal users: be sure to "close" your output file or the output will not 
  appear </LI></UL>Please let me know (<A 
href="mailto:kolstad@ace.delos.com">mailto:kolstad@ace.delos.com</A>) if you 
ever have to wait ten minutes for a response. They should arrive within a 
minute. </TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>Why not give it a try? Submit the program above, <FONT color=#ff0000>using 
your own ID</FONT>, to the standard submission address: <A 
href="mailto:grader@ace.delos.com">mailto:grader@ace.delos.com</A>. The subject 
line is ignored, by the way. Your results should be returned via email quickly.
