<H3>Who We Are </H3>
<P>The USA Computing Olympiad fosters pre-college computing through training, 
contests, and international competitions. A director and a handful of coaches 
organize these features and accompany students who represent the USA in 
international venues. Find a wealth of details and other information at the <A 
href="http://www.usaco.org/">USACO Web Site</A>. 
<H3>Specific USACO Goals</H3>
<P>Specific goals of this year's USACO include: 
<UL>
  <LI>Train USA team to win multiple gold medals at the next IOI. 
  <LI>Engage USA students in learning and growing to achieve the first goal 
  <LI>Conduct an eight day programming camp for the best 15 USA students in 
  order to identify the final four USA representatives for international 
  competition. </LI></UL>
<H3>About This Web Site </H3>
<P>This web site is designed to accomplish the goals above. 
<UL>
  <LI>It's password protected. 
  <LI>All functions are available 24 hours/day with mechanical responses and 
  tracking so anyone can learn at their own pace and with no pressure. 
  <LI>Instructional text, problems, and analyses are concise (in order to 
  minimize time spent reading vs. programming) 
  <LI>Over 100 contest-style problems are complemented by almost two dozen 
  instructional texts on every type of problem from the programming contest 
  domain. 
  <LI>The problems are interspersed throughout the the sections based more on 
  difficulty (easier ones first!) than on "problem type". 
  <LI>A web-based sequencing system to guide students through ever more 
  challenging problems and texts. 
  <LI>Detailed explanations of algorithms and problems in standard IOI format to 
  familiarize competitors with international competitive environments and 
  challenges 
  <LI>Tasks that require programs to be submitted to an automatic grading system 
  for evaluation against a broad spectrum of test cases. 
  <LI>Quick turnaround on feedback for problem grading (usually under one 
  minute). 
  <LI>Analysis pages to explicate details of problem solutions and show a 
  well-coded and well-commented solution. 
  <LI>Occasional feedback from coaches on submitted programs </LI></UL>
<H3>Awards and Privileges To Earn </H3>
<P>The USACO will send you certificates as you progress through this site. 
Furthermore, outstanding participation will enhance your chances of being chosen 
for USACO training camp in June. 
<P>Small awards will also be given at the end of the season to those who have 
the fastest solutions for some of the more complicated problems. Watch the web 
site for the standings as they emerge. 
<H3>A Surprising Comment </H3>
<P>So far, everyone's first impression is that the problems all look simple and 
that solving them will be very easy. The test data ranges from simple to 
challenging, and the problems rise to the level of the IOI by the second page. 
Give it a whirl! 
<P>Don't be fooled by the first few problems. Subsequent problems are ever more 
challenging. 
<H3>How Long Does This Take? </H3>
<P>Different people will take different spans of time to move through this 
material, especially the 100+ programming challenges. Some students already have 
years and years of experience, some at the international level. Others are just 
beginning to compete. Any rate much lower than one problem per week is probably 
not high enough to achieve a rewarding training effect. It is anticipated some 
of the best students will average one problem or more per day for the first two 
sections. 
<P>To get the most out of this web site, you should solve the problems in order, 
understand each paragraph of the instructional texts, and digest the analyses to 
see how they apply to your solutions. Feel free to improve your solution after 
you read the analysis. Furthermore, feel free to send us new or better analyses 
if you have them. 
<H3>Administrivia</H3>
<P>A few items to ease your use of the site:
