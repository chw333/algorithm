<P>Hal Burch conducted an analysis over spring break of 1999 and made an amazing 
discovery: there are only 16 types of programming contest problems! Furthermore, 
the top several comprise almost 80% of the problems seen at the IOI. Here they 
are: 
<UL>
  <LI>Dynamic Programming 
  <LI>Greedy 
  <LI>Complete Search 
  <LI>Flood Fill 
  <LI>Shortest Path 
  <LI>Recursive Search Techniques 
  <LI>Minimum Spanning Tree 
  <LI>Knapsack 
  <LI>Computational Geometry 
  <LI>Network Flow 
  <LI>Eulerian Path 
  <LI>Two-Dimensional Convex Hull 
  <LI>BigNums 
  <LI>Heuristic Search 
  <LI>Approximate Search 
  <LI>Ad Hoc Problems </LI></UL>
<P>The most challenging problems are Combination Problems which involve a loop 
(combinations, subsets, etc.) around one of the above algorithms - or even a 
loop of one algorithm with another inside it. These seem extraordinarily tricky 
to get right, even though conceptually they are ``obvious''. 
<P>If you can master solving just 40% of these problem types, you can almost 
guarantee a silver medal at the IOI. Mastering 80% moves you into the gold range 
almost for sure. Of course, `mastery' is a tough nut to crack! We'll be 
supplying a plethora of problems so that you can hone your skills in the quest 
for international fame. </TD></TR></TABLE>
