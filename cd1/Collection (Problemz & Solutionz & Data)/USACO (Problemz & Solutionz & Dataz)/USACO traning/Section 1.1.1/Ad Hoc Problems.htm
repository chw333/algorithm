<H1>Ad Hoc Problems</H1></CENTER>
<P>`Ad hoc' problems are those whose algorithms do not fall into standard 
categories with well-studied solutions. Each ad hoc problem is different; no 
specific or general techniques exist to solve them. 
<P>Of course, this makes the problems the `fun' ones, since each one presents a 
new challenge. The solutions might require a novel data structure or an unusual 
set of loops or conditionals. Sometimes they require special combinations that 
are rare or at least rarely encountered. 
<P>Ad hoc problems usually require careful reading and usually yield to an 
attack that revolves around carefully sequencing the instructions given in the 
problem. 
<P>Ad hoc problems can still require reasonable optimizations and at least a 
degree of analysis that enables one to avoid loops nested five deep, for 
example. 
<P>More ad hoc problems appear on this web site than any other kind of problem. 
Always be ready for an ad hoc problem if you can not classify a problem as one 
of the other standard types (to be listed later). <BR><BR>
