<p> A number that reads the same from right to left as when read from
left to right is called a palindrome.  The number 12321 is a palindrome;
the number 77778 is not.  Of course, palindromes have neither leading
nor trailing zeroes, so 0220 is not a palindrome.

<p> The number 21 (base 10) is not palindrome in base 10, but the number
21 (base 10) is, in fact, a palindrome in base 2 (10101).

<p>
Write a program that reads two numbers (expressed in base 10):
<ul>
        <li> N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 15) 
        <li> S (0 &lt; S &lt; 10000)
</ul>
and then finds and prints (in base 10) the first N numbers strictly
greater than S that are palindromic when written in two or more number
bases (2 &lt;= base &lt;= 10).

<p> Solutions to this problem do not require manipulating integers larger
than the standard 32 bits.

<h3>PROGRAM NAME: dualpal</h3>

N lines, each with a base 10 number that is palindromic when expressed
in at least two of the bases 2..10.  The numbers should be listed
in order from smallest to largest.
