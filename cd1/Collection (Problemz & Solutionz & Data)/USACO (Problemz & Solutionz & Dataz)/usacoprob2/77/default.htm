<h1>Greedy Gift Givers</h1>
</center>

<p> You are to determine, for a group of gift-giving friends, how much
more each person gives than they receive (and vice versa for those who
view gift giving with cynicism). In this problem, each person sets aside
some money for gift-giving and divides this money evenly among all those
to whom gifts are given. However, in any group of friends, some people
are more giving than others (or at least may have more acquaintances)
and some people have more money than others.

<p> Given a group of friends, no one of whom has a name longer than 14
characters, the money each person in the group spends on gifts, and a
(sub)list of friends to whom each person gives gifts, determine how much
more (or less) each person in the group gives than they receive.

<h3>IMPRORTANT NOTE</h3>

<p> The grader machine is a Linux machine that uses standard Unix
conventions:  end of line is a single character often known as '\n'.
This differs from Windows, which ends lines with two charcters,
'\n' and '\r'.  Do not let your program get trapped by this!

<h3>PROGRAM NAME: gift1</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>
<p>The input is a group of gift-givers which consists of several lines:
<table>
<tr> <td> Line 1: </td> <td> The number of people in the group, 2 &lt;= NP &lt;= 10</td>
<tr> <td> Lines 2..NP+1: </td> <td> NP names of the people in the group, one per line </td>
</tr>
<tr> <td valign='top'> Lines NP+2..end: </td> <td>NP groups of lines organized like this:
<table>
<tr><td>The first line in the group tells the person's name who will be giving gifts.
<tr><td>The second line in the group contains two numbers: The initial
	amount of money (in the range 0..2000) spent on gifts by the giver
	and then the number of people to whom the giver will give gifts,
	NG<sub>i</sub> (0 &lt;= NG<sub>i</sub> &lt;= NP-1).
<tr><td> If NG<sub>i</sub> is nonzero, each of the next NG<sub>i</sub> lines lists the
        the name of a recipient of a gift.

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

<p>The output is NP lines, each with the name of a person followed by
a single blank followed by the net gain or loss (final_money_value - 
initial_money_value) for that person.  The names should be printed in
the same order they appear on line 2 of the input.

<p> All gifts are integers. Each person gives the same integer amount
of money to each friend to whom any money is given, and gives as much
as possible that meets this constraint. Any money not given is kept by
the giver.
