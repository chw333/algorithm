<p>In the square below, each row, each column and the two diagonals can
be read as a five digit prime number.  The rows are read from left to
right.  The columns are read from top to bottom.  Both diagonals are
read from left to right.

<UL>
<LI> The prime numbers' digits must sum to the same number.

<LI> The digit in the top left-hand corner of the square is pre-determined
(1 in the example).

<LI> A prime number may be used more than once in the same square.

<LI> If there are several solutions, all must be presented (sorted in
numerical order as if the 25 digits were all one long number).

<LI> A five digit prime number cannot begin with a zero (e.g., 00003 is
NOT a five digit prime number).

<h3>PROGRAM NAME: prime3</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

<p>A single line with two space-separated integers: the sum of the
digits and the digit in the upper left hand corner of the square.

<h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file prime3.in) </h3>

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

<p>Five lines of five characters each for each solution found, where
each line in turn consists of a five digit prime number.  Print a blank
line between solutions.  If there are no prime squares for the input
data, output a single line containing "NONE". 


<h3>SAMPLE OUTPUT (file prime3.out)</h3>
