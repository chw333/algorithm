<p> You just inherited the rights to N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 20) previously
unreleased songs recorded by the popular group Raucous Rockers. You plan
to release a set of M  (1 &lt;= M &lt;= 20) compact disks with a selection
of these songs. Each disk can hold a maximum of T (1 &lt;= T &lt;= 20)
minutes of music, and a song can not overlap from one disk to another.

<p> Since you are a classical music fan and have no way to judge the
artistic merits of these songs, you decide on the following criteria for
making the selection:

<ul>
<li> The songs on the set of disks must appear in the order of the 
     dates that they were written. 
<li> The total number of songs included will be maximized. 
</ul>
