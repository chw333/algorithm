<p> The advice to &quot;buy low&quot; is half the formula to success in
the stock market. But to be considered a great investor you must also
follow this problems' advice:
<center>
                <i>&quot;Buy low, buy lower&quot;</i>
</center>

<p> That is, each time you buy a stock, you must purchase more at a
lower price than the previous time you bought it.  The more times you
buy at a lower price than before, the better! Your goal is to see how
many times you can continue purchasing at ever lower prices.

<p> You will be given the daily selling prices of a stock over a period
of time.  You can choose to buy stock on any of the days. Each time you
choose to buy, the price must be lower than the previous time you bought
stock. Write a program which identifies which days you should buy stock
in order to maximize the number of times you buy.

<p>
By way of example, suppose on successive days stock is selling like this:
<pre>
 Day   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12
Price 68 69 54 64 68 64 70 67 78 62 98 87
</pre>

<p> In the example above, the best investor (by this problem, anyway)
can buy at most four times if they purchase at a lower price each time.
One four day sequence (there might be others) of acceptable buys is:
<pre>
Day    2  5  6 10
Price 69 68 64 62
</pre>

<h3>PROGRAM NAME: buylow</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

<table border="1">
<tr> <td> Line 1: </td> <td> N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 5000), the 
number of days for which stock prices are available.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td> Line 2..etc: </td> <td> A series of N positive space-separated
	  integers (which may require more than one line of data) that
	  tell the price for that day.  The integers will fit into
	  32 bits quite nicely.</td> </tr>
</table>

<h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file buylow.in) </h3>

<pre>
12
68 69 54 64 68 64 70 67
78 62 98 87
</pre>

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

<p>Two integers on a single line:
<ul>
<li> the length of the longest sequence of decreasing prices
<li> the number of sequences that have this length
</ul>

<p> In counting the number of solutions, two potential solutions are
considered the same (and would only count as one solution) if they repeat
the same string of decreasing prices, that is, if they &quot;look the
same&quot; when the successive prices are compared.  Thus, two different
sequence of &quot;buy&quot; days could produce the same string of
decreasing prices and be counted as only a single solution.

<h3>SAMPLE OUTPUT (file buylow.out)</h3>

<pre>
