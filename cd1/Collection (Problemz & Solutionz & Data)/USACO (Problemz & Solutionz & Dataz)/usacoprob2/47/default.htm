Figure 1: Each of the 26 lowercase letters and its value
</CENTER>

<P> Letter games are popular at home and on television.  In one version of
the game, every letter has a value, and you collect letters to form one or
more words giving the highest possible score.  Unless you have `a way with
words', you will try all the words you know, sometimes looking up the
spelling, and then compute the scores.  Obviously, this can be done more
accurately by computer.

<P> Given the values in Figure 1, a list of words, and the letters
collected:  find the highest scoring words or pairs of words that can be
formed.

<h3>PROGRAM NAME: lgame</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

One line with a string of lowercase letters (from `<TT>a</TT>' to
`<TT>z</TT>').  The string consists of at least&nbsp;3 and at most 7
letters in arbitrary order.

<h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file lgame.in) </h3>

<pre>
prmgroa
</pre>

<h3>DICTIONARY FORMAT</h3>

At most 40,000 lines, each containing a string of at least&nbsp;3 and at
most&nbsp;7 lowercase letters.  At the end of this file is a line with a
single period (`<TT>.</TT>').  The file is sorted alphabetically and
contains no duplicates.

<h3>SAMPLE DICTIONARY (file <a href="/usaco/lgame.dict">lgame.dict</a>) </h3>

<pre>
profile
program
prom
rag
ram
rom
.
</pre>

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

<p>On the first line, your program should write the highest possible score,
and on each of the following lines, all the words and/or word pairs from
file <TT>lgame.dict</TT> with this score.  Sort the output alphabetically
by first word, and if tied, by second word.  A letter must not occur more
often in an output line than in the input line.  Use the letter values
given in Figure 1.

<P> When a combination of two words can be formed with the given letters,
the words should be printed on the same line separated by a space.  The
two words should be in alphabetical order; for example, do not write
`<TT>rag prom</TT>', only write `<TT>prom rag</TT>'.  A pair in an output
line may consist of two identical words.

<h3>SAMPLE OUTPUT (file lgame.out)</h3>

<pre>
24
program
prom rag
</pre>
