<h1>Shaping Regions</h1>
</center>

<p> N opaque rectangles (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000) of various colors are
placed on a white sheet of paper whose size is A wide by B long.  The
rectangles are put with their sides parallel to the sheet's borders.
All rectangles fall within the borders of the sheet so that different
figures of different colors will be seen.

<p> The coordinate system has its origin (0,0) at the sheet's lower left
corner with axes parallel to the sheet's borders.

<h3>PROGRAM NAME: rect1</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

<p>The order of the input lines dictates the order of laying down the
rectangles.  The first input line is a rectangle "on the bottom".

<table border="1">
<tr> <td> Line 1: </td> <td> A, B, and N, space separated (1 &lt;= A,B
&lt;= 10,000)</td></tr>
<tr> <td> Lines 2-N+1: </td> <td>Five integers: llx, lly, urx, ury,
color:  the lower left coordinates and upper right coordinates of the
rectangle whose color is `color' (1 &lt;= color &lt;= 2500) to be placed
on the white sheet.  The color 1 is the same color of white as the sheet
upon which the rectangles are placed.</td>
</table>

<h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file rect1.in) </h3>

<pre>
20 20 3
2 2 18 18 2
0 8 19 19 3
8 0 10 19 4
</pre>

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

The output file should contain a list of all the colors that can be seen
along with the total area of each color that can be seen (even if the
regions of color are disjoint), ordered by increasing color.  Do not
display colors with no area.
