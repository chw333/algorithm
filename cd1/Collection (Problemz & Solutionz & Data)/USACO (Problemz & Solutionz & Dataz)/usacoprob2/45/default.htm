<h1>What Time Is It?</h1>
</center>

<p> Years ago, Brian Redman amused the entire networking community by
asking on a newsgroup, ``What time is it?  E-mail me and I'll summarize
to the net.''  Ha ha.

<p> Write a program to convert a time expressed as hour:minute to
the (stylized, see below) American english language version of the time.
Here are the rules to implement (note that they might be different from
what you are used to and are certainly different from British rules):

<ul>
  <li> Capitalize the first letter of the output
  <li> Compound english numbers are hyphenated, e.g.: forty-four
  <li> Express x:00 as [x_in_english] o'clock
  <li> Express x:15 as Quarter past [x_in_english]
  <li> Express x:30 as [x_in_english] thirty
  <li> Express x:45 as Quarter to [next_hour_in_english]
  <li> Otherwise, express x:nn as:
  <ul>
    <li> [x_in_english] [nn_in_english] when nn&lt;45
    <li> [60-nn_in_english] to [next_hour_in_english] when nn&gt;45
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>
Examples:
<ul>
<li> 5:00   Five o'clock
<li> 10:10  Ten ten
<li> 9:22   Nine twenty-two
<li> 5:15   Quarter past five
<li> 2:30   Two thirty
<li> 6:40   Six forty
<li> 5:45   Quarter to six
<li> 8:47   Thirteen to nine
</ul>


<h3>PROGRAM NAME: clock</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

A single line with a time expressed as hour:minutes.  Each hour is in
the range 1..12; minutes are always expressed in two digits and are in
the range 0..59

<h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file clock.in) </h3>

5:45


<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

A single line with the time expressed as English.

<h3>SAMPLE OUTPUT (file clock.out)</h3>
