<center>A Special Treat</center>

<P>Farmer John wants to place a big square barn on his square farm. He
hates to cut down trees on his farm and wants to find a location for his
barn that enables him to build it only on land that is already clear of
trees. For our purposes, his land is divided into N x N parcels. The input
contains a list of parcels that contain trees. Your job is to determine
and report the largest possible square barn that can be placed on his land
without having to clear away trees. The barn sides must be parallel to the
horizontal or vertical axis.

<h3>EXAMPLE</h3>

<P>Consider the following grid of Farmer John's land where `.' represents
a parcel with no trees and `#' represents a parcel with trees:
<PRE>

          1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
        1 . . . . . . . .
        2 . # . . . # . .
        3 . . . . . . . .
        4 . . . . . . . .
        5 . . . . . . . .
        6 . . # . . . . .
        7 . . . . . . . .
        8 . . . . . . . .
</PRE>

<P>The largest barn is 5 x 5 and can be placed in either of two locations
in the lower right part of the grid.
