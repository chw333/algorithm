<p> The Shuttle Puzzle of size 3 consists of 3 white marbles, 3 black
marbles, and a strip of wood with 7 holes. The marbles of the same color
are placed in the holes at the opposite ends of the strip, leaving the
center hole empty.
<pre>
INITIAL STATE: WWW_BBB 
GOAL STATE: BBB_WWW
</pre>

<p> To solve the shuttle puzzle, use only two types of moves. Move 1
marble 1 space (into the empty hole) or jump 1 marble over 1 marble of
the opposite color (into the empty hole). You may not back up, and you
may not jump over 2 marbles.

<p> A Shuttle Puzzle of size N consists of N white marbles and N black
marbles and 2N+1 holes.

<p> Here's one solution for the problem of size 3 showing
the initial, intermediate, and end states:

<p> Write a program that will solve the SHUTTLE PUZZLE for any size N
(1 &lt;= N &lt;= 12) in the minimum number of moves and display the
successive moves, 20 per line.

<h3>PROGRAM NAME: shuttle</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

A single line with the integer N.

<h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file shuttle.in) </h3>

<pre>
3
</pre>

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

<p>The list of moves expressed as space-separated integers, 20 per line
(except possibly the last line).  Number the marbles/holes from the
left, starting with one.

<p>Output the the solution that would appear first among the set of
minimal solutions sorted numerically (first by the first number, using
the second number for ties, and so on).

<h3>SAMPLE OUTPUT (file shuttle.out)</h3>
