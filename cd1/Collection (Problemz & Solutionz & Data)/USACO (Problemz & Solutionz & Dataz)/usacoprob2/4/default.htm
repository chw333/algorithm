</center>

<p> Farmer John has three milking buckets of capacity A, B, and C liters.
Each of the numbers A, B, and C is an integer from 1 through 20,
inclusive. Initially, buckets A and B are empty while bucket C is full
of milk. Sometimes, FJ pours milk from one bucket to another until the
second bucket is filled or the first bucket is empty. Once begun, a pour
must be completed, of course. Being thrifty, no milk may be tossed out.

<p> Write a program to help FJ determine what amounts of milk he can leave in bucket 
C when he begins with three buckets as above, pours milk among the buckets for a 
while, and then notes that bucket A is empty.

<h3>PROGRAM NAME: milk3</h3>
