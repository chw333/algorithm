<p> Write a program that will accept a fraction of the form N/D, where
N is the numerator and D is the denominator and print the decimal
representation.  If the decimal representation has a repeating sequence
of digits, indicate the sequence by enclosing it in brackets. For example,
1/3 = .33333333...is denoted as 0.(3), and 41/333 = 0.123123123...is
denoted as 0.(123).  Use xxx.0 to denote an integer. Typical conversions
are:

<pre>
1/3     =  0.(3)
22/5    =  4.4
1/7     =  0.(142857)
2/2     =  1.0
3/8     =  0.375
45/56   =  0.803(571428)
</pre>


<h3>PROGRAM NAME: fracdec</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

A single line with two space separated integers, N and D,
1 &lt;= N,D &lt;= 100000.

<h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file fracdec.in) </h3>

<pre>
45 56
</pre>

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

The decimal expansion, as detailed above.  If the expansion exceeds 76
characters in length, print it on multiple lines with 76 characters per
line.

<h3>SAMPLE OUTPUT (file fracdec.out)</h3>

<pre>
0.803(571428)
</pre>
