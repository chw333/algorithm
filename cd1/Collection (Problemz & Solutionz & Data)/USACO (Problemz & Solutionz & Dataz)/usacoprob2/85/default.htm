<p>
In this problem, `lattice points' in the plane are points with integer
coordinates.

<p> In order to contain his cows, Farmer John constructs a triangular
electric fence by stringing a &quot;hot&quot; wire from  the origin (0,0)
to a lattice point [n,m] (0&lt;n&lt;32000, 0&lt;m&lt;32000), then to a
lattice point on the positive x axis [p,0] (p&gt;0), and then back to the
origin (0,0).

<p> A cow can be placed at each lattice point within the fence without
touching the fence (very thin cows). Cows can not be placed on lattice
points that the fence touches. How many cows can a given fence hold?

<h3>PROGRAM NAME: fence9</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

<p> The single input line contains three space-separated integers that denote
n, m, and p.

<h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file fence9.in)</h3>
<pre>
7 5 10
</pre>

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

<p>
A single line with a single integer that represents the number of cows the
specified fence can hold.

<h3>SAMPLE OUTPUT (file fence9.out)</h3>
<pre>
20
</pre>
