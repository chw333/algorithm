<p> Farmer John wishes to build a fence to contain his cows, but he's a
bit short on cash right.  Any fence he builds must contain all of the
favorite grazing spots for his cows.  Given the location of these spots,
determine the length of the shortest fence which encloses them.

<h3>PROGRAM NAME: fc</h3>
<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

<p> The first line of the input file contains one integer, N.  N (0 &lt;=
N &lt;= 10,000) is the number of grazing spots that Farmer john wishes to
enclose.  The next N line consists of two real numbers, Xi and Yi,
corresponding to the location of the grazing spots in the plane (-1,000,000
&lt;= Xi,Yi &lt;= 1,000,000).  The numbers will be in decimal format.

<h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file fc.in)</h3>
