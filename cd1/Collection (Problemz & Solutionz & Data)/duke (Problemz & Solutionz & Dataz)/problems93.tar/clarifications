Enter your question below, then exit the editor:

what happens if a person has no friends but has money?



Response:

Note the line of the problem that says:

Any money not given is kept and is part of a person's "net worth"
printed in the output.  For example:

     joe 20 0

would mean joe has at LEAST 20 at the end, because he keeps the 20
(since he doesn't give it away, it's left over and he keeps it)

Enter your question below, then exit the editor:

In problem five you say 256 nodes.
Do you mean down to level 8 or level 256?




Response:

256 is the bound on the nodes, the tree can be up to 256 levels
deep (e.g., all left-children).  Note that 'complete specification'
doesn't mean 'complete (all levels full) tree'

Enter your question below, then exit the editor:

In the example city in "The Problem" section, the
specification seems to suggest that there is a
path from 0 to 3 (0->1->2->3), but the explanation
excludes this from consideration ("..and no other
routes.")  Why?



Response:

Our mistake, there are two routes from 0 to 3:

  0->1->2->3

and

  0->2->3

However, all submissions have been correctly judged, this was a typo
in the explanation.
