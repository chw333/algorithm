The solutions presented here are not the "best" solutions to any given
problem in the problem set.  We offer the solutions as evidence that
all problems are solvable.

The solutions do, however, solve the problems as specified, and were
used to generate the ouput files.

Note that problem 3 does not have a unique solution.  The second to
last data set also has an error in that the number 39 is listed twice,
which violates the description in the problem set.
