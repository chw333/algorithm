There are four things in this distribution directory:

problems90.tar.Z: Contains the problem set used in the October 1990 Duke
Internet programming contest. The rules, problems, solutions, test data, and
correct output are all given, along with the list of participants, team
names, and scores.

problems91.tar.Z contains the problems, solutions in C, test data and
expected output from the November 1991 Duke Internet programming contest.

problems92.tar.Z contains the problems, solutions in C, test data and
expected output from the November 1992 Duke Internet programming contest.

run-a-contest.tar.Z contains all of problems.tar.Z (as
duke-contest/netwide90/ftp/contest) as well as all of the support
structure needed to run your own contest. This software is supplied
AS-IS, with no promise of support from us. Have fun. If you plan to
run an internet-wide contest, please coordinate with us, as there may
be others with the same idea.

contest91.tar.Z contains similar material to run-a-contest.tar.Z, but does
not include problems91.tar.Z.  It contains most of the material from
run-a-contest.tar.Z with the updates needed for the 1991 contest.

judge-software-1.0.tar.Z contains the distributed judging software used in
the 1992 contest.  It is mostly written in Perl, and is capable of handling
hundreds of submissions by distributing the judging across several
machines.  The software is very Unix-centric.  It also includes the scripts
needed by the participants to submit programs/questions.  There is a
PostScript paper which describes the contest software architecture as
applied to our specific contest.

TO RETRIEVE, eg, problems91.tar.Z
