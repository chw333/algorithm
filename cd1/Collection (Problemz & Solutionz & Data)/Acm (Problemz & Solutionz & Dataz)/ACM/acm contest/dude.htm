<h1>Dude…Where’s My Gas?</h1>

<h3>input file: <code>dude.in</code></h3>

<p>Joe likes highway driving on the edge…of an empty gas tank,
that is.   Joe's fuel gauge only
registers the number of eighths of a tank remaining (i.e., 1/8, 2/8,
…8/8).   One of his favorite stretches of
highway has exits spaced evenly so that he can reach the same number of exits, <i>k</i>,
for each eighth of a tank of gas (for example, with 2/8 tank of gas, he can
reach 2<i>k</i> exits).   Exits may or
may not have a gas station.   Given the
number of eighths of a tank of gas in Joe’s car, the value of <i>k</i>, and the
locations of the gas stations, determine the farthest exit with a gas station
that Joe can reach using only the gas in his tank (i.e., no fill-ups of the
tank are allowed en route).   Of course,
it is possible that Joe will run out of gas…</p>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>Each data set begins with a line containing a single integer
<i>t</i>, indicating the number of eighths of a tank of gas in Joe’s car (where
1  &lt;=
<i>t </i> &lt;=
8).   The next line contains a single
integer <i>k</i>, indicating how many highway exits can be reached per 1/8 tank
of gas, (where 1     &lt;=
<i>k</i> &lt;= 8).   Starting on the next line of the
input, and possibly continuing over several input lines, will appear the
numbers of the exits at which gas stations are located.
Joe’s first available exit is always 1, and
the exits are numbered consecutively.  
The furthest possible exit number is 1000. 
The list of exits will be terminated by a –1.
Exit numbers in a particular data set will
not be duplicated but may be listed in any order.
Your program should stop processing data sets when it reaches a
value of 0 for <i>t</i>.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p>For each data set, output the exit number of the last gas
station that the car can reach.   If the
car runs out of gas before it can reach a gas station, output that information
instead.   Follow the format illustrated
in the sample output.</p>
