<P align=justify>Jashim runs a juice shop near the university campus. Students 
buy their weekly juice stock from his shop. Every morning juice producers bring 
their supplies to his shop in jars of two different sizes. Each of these jars 
can contain a particular volume (expressed in liter) of juice and has marks to 
indicate that volume. The suppliers have jars of different volumes and jars 
given today are not necessarily the same in volume as those given yesterday. Had 
the shop been at some other location, Jashim wouldn’t have faced any difficulty 
with the jars, but the students like to buy the smallest volume of juice Jashim 
is ready to provide. So, every morning, Jashim has to undergo a long process of 
making the smallest volume of juice possible with the given jars.</P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>Jashim doesn’t have any measuring pot for direct measurement of 
volume. Rather he uses a very large barrel (of almost infinite capacity) for 
this purpose. He takes one of the supplied jars and either pours all the juice 
into the barrel or takes it out from the barrel into the supplied jar to jar’s 
full capacity. The volume of juice transferred in any case is equal to the 
supplied jar’s capacity. In this way, he uses both types of jar and pours juice 
into or takes it out of the barrel as many times as necessary to get the minimum 
volume achievable by this mechanism. After, the minimum volume is prepared, he 
uses this as measuring volume to sell juice of that volume. Now you are to help 
Jashim.</P>

<P align=justify>Input</P></B></FONT>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>Input file contains multiple cases. Each case contains two 
numbers <I>m</I> and <I>n</I> (1 <FONT face=Symbol>£</FONT> <I>n</I> <FONT 
face=Symbol>£</FONT> <I>m</I> <FONT face=Symbol>£</FONT> 2147483647) where 
<I>m</I> and <I>n</I> are the volumes (in liter) of two types of supplied jars. 
So, you can pour <I>m</I> (or <I>n</I>) liters of juice into the barrel and also 
take <I>m</I> (or <I>n</I>) liters of juice out of the barrel at each step. You 
are to determine the minimum volume (in liter) achievable by this process. 
Besides, determine the minimum number of times you are to pour in and take out 
from the barrel. Input terminates by a pair of 0’s. You need not process this 
last case.</P>
<P align=justify></P><B><FONT size=4>
<P align=justify>Output</P></B></FONT>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>For each case, output consists of three lines. First line 
specifies the minimum volume achievable by this process. Second line specifies 
the minimum number of times volume <I>m</I> has been poured into or taken out 
from the barrel and third line specifies the same for volume <I>n</I>. If some 
volume need not be taken out or poured in, print "<I>m</I> (or <I>n</I>) 
liter(s) not needed". Print a blank line between successive cases. Follow the 
format given in sample output.</P>
