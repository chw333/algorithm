<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Consider several lines of text writen with capital letters and one character called KEY, specified on a line preceding the text. The words in the text are separated by spaces. There are no words splitted between two lines.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Write a program to display an  index of all words within the text starting with the KEY. The index must be alphabetically sorted. Each word appears in the index only once and must be followed by the numbers of all the lines in which it appears. Only a single occurrence of each word on a line must be included in the index.</P>
