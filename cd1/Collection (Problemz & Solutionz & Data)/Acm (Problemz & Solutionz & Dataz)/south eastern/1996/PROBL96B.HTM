The wages of the employees of a company are computed on the basis of a set of relative rankings of the form<B> x R y</B>, where <B>x</B> and <B>y</B> are names and/or numbers, and <B>R</B> is a relational operator from the set { &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, = }. The meaning of  <B>x R y</B> is:</P>

<TT>      the salary of <B>x </B>|<B>                            </B>|<B> </B>the<B> </B>salary of <B>y</B></P>

          number <B>x    </B>|                            |<B>   </B>number <B>y</P>

The problem is to compute the minimum and the maximum wage which each of the employees can get according to a given set of relations. It is known that: the name of an employee is at most 8 characters long; the wages are</HV> <HV>integers from 1 to 99999; only integer numbers appear in relations; the number of employees cannot exceed 100 and the number of relations is at most 1000.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The program input is from a file which contains several sets of relations as shown in figure 1. The relations of a set are one on a line and their elements are separated by spaces. Each set of relations ends with a line which contains a minus sign only. The format of input data is correct.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The result of the program is on standard output. For each consistent set of relations the result is the message <B>OK </B>followed by the list of employees (if any), in alphabetical order, together with their minimum and maximum wages as shown in figure 1. If a set of relations is inconsistent then the message <B>No solution</B> is printed for that set. Notice that for a set of relations which contains only numbers the result can be either the message <B>OK</B> or <B>No solution</B>.</P>
