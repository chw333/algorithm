width=356> Writings discovered inside the walls of the Great Pyramids have often 
revealed the ancient Egyptian's affinity for mathematical logic and problem 
solving. 
<P>Recently, a team of archaeologists returning from an expedition to the 
pyramids brought back several examples of ancient hieroglyphics which, when 
translated into their English equivalents, provided further evidence of their 
mathematical prowess. 
<P>The grid at the left, one of many derived from the hieroglyphics, was 
presented to a team of mathematical scholars for their analysis. After careful 
study, they determined that this grid represented a mathematical challenge. To 
the best of their knowledge, the goal seems to be to fill in the empty spaces 
with the numbers from one through nine, subject to the following constraints: 
<UL>
  <LI>numbers initially appearing inthe grid are fixed and <EM>cannot be 
  moved</EM>; 
  <LI>each number may appear only once in each horizontal row and vertical 
  column; and 
  <LI>each number may appear only once in each smaller square of nine as 
  delineated by the heavier lines in the grid diagram </LI></UL>In an effort to 
better understand this ancient civilization (and to use the technology of the 
present to address the challenges of the past), your team has decided to develop 
a program that will "complete the squares", so to speak, found in the pyramids. 
<BR clear=both>
<H3>Input</H3>The input will consist of a series of Egyptian squares. On the 
first line of the input file will be a single integer stating the number of 
Egyptian squares in the dataset. This will be followed by data for that many 
Egyptian squares. Each Egyptian square will consist of nine lines of nine 
single-digit integers that are separated by spaces. In each Egyptian square, at 
least four fixed numbers in each row, column, and smaller square of nine will be 
provided, with the empty spaces denoted by the integer zero. Every number from 1 
to 9 will appear at least once in each Egyptian square as a fixed digit. Only 
valid data will appear in the input file. 
<P>
<H3>Output</H3>Since the Egyptians prided themselves on their mathematical 
abilities, it is safe to assume that each square will have at least one 
solution. Should multiple answers be possible, your program may output any of 
these answers (but only one). Each Egyptian square is to be assigned an 
identification number, beginning with square #1. A heading of EGYPTIAN SQUARE 
#<EM>n</EM> should be output, followed by a blank line, and the lines showing 
the solved square. The numbers within an Egyptian square should be output 
right-justified in a field width of two character positions. The output for one 
Egyptian square is to be separated from the output of the next Egyptian square 
by a blank line. Refer to the example on the next page.
