<P>A particular part of the world has recently been experiencing a sudden and 
marked proliferation of pirate radio stations. So much so, in fact, that a group 
of concerned nations have asked for you assistance in pinpointing the source of 
the illegal transmissions. The respective governments have agreed to provide you 
with data form a set of mobile tracking units, each capable of determining its 
distance from a radio signal's point of broadcast. Armed with the information 
from three of these units and a two-dimensional map of the area, you are to 
write a program which will determine the distance and the direction of the 
particular pirate trasmitter from the nearest city in the area. 
<P>
<H3>Input</H3>The input will consist of a two-dimensional map (using Cartesian 
coordinates) followed by the number of pirate signals that must be located and a 
corresponding number of pirate station datasets. 
<P>In themap, the data for each city will appear on a separate line. The data 
for each city will consist of a 15-character name followed by the city's x- and 
y-coordinates and a radius. The x- and y-coordinates give the city's 
geographical center while the radius gives the distance from the center of the 
city to the city limits (all cities map be considered to be circular for this 
problem). There will be no more than 50 cities and the last city on the map will 
be located at the origin (0.0, 0.0). 
<P>Following the map is a single integer (on a line by itself) which gives the 
number of pirate station datasets that follow. Each pirate station dataset will 
consist of nine readings on a single line, separated by spaces. The first three 
readings correspond to mobile tracking unit A, the next three to unit B, and the 
last three to unit C. The first two readings in a set of three are the x- and y- 
coordinates where the mobile tracking unit itself is located while the third 
reading is the distance the unit determined itself to be from the source of the 
pirate radio station signal. Note that all coordinate and distance values are 
given in kilometers and should be stored as real numbers. The locations of the 
three mobile tracking units reporting information on the pirate signal will not 
be collinear and will always be at least 10 kilometers apart. No city will be 
located more than 6000 kilometers away from the city at the origin. You may 
assume that only valid data will be supplied. 
<P>
<H3>Output</H3>Your program should process each pirate station dataset using the 
information supplied by the three mobile tracking units and produce a summary 
line for each pirate signal which realates the source of the broadcast to the 
nearest town on the map. Specifically, your output should supply the distance 
from the illegal transmitter to the city limits (not the geographical center) of 
the nearest city, the principle compass direction of the illegal transmitter 
from the nearest city (<CODE>North</CODE>, <CODE>North East</CODE>, 
<CODE>East</CODE>, <CODE>South East</CODE>, <CODE>South</CODE>, <CODE>South 
West</CODE>, <CODE>West</CODE>, or <CODE>North West</CODE>), and the name of 
that city. 
<P>The distance should be correct to within ¡¾ 0.02 of a kilometer and output to 
two digits of accuracy. To determine the compass direction of the pirate 
transmitter from the nearest city, each of the eight principle directions should 
be considered to be at the center of a 45¡Æ arc in that direction. Illegal 
transmitters which fall anywhere within a particular arc are considered to be in 
that direction. Thus if due North is at 0¡Æ, a transmitter that was at an angle 
between 22¡Æ and 67¡Æ (inclusive) would be considered <CODE>North East</CODE> of 
the city while a transmitter that was at an angle between 68¡Æ and 112¡Æ 
(inclusive) would be considered <CODE>East</CODE> of the city. When determining 
the direction of the pirate transmitter, an angle should be rounded off to the 
nearest whole degree. 
<P>Pirate transmitters that are located inside of a city's limits should be 
reported as originating from that city (no distance or directional information 
should be output in this case). All pirate transmitter reports should be 
preceded by a transmitter I. D. number (starting with transmitter 1). Refer to 
the following example for the acceptable phrasing of your output.

</PRE>According to the above dataset, the town of Caniama is located at 
(-803.24, 1351.68) and has a radius of 6.53 kilometers, and there are 5 pirate 
transmitters in the pirate station dataset. Furthermore, in the case of pirate 
station #2 the mobile tracking units are reporting the following information: 
Mobile Tracking Unit A, which is located at (-1021.9, -1064.67), has detected 
the transmission from 2164.66 kilometers away; Unit B, located at (1089.23, 0.0) 
isreceiving the broadcast from 1796.91 kilometers away; and Unit C, located at 
(993.94, -1516.17), is picking it up from 2882.78 kilometers away.
