<P>A word frame puzzle is a new twist on the classic word search puzzle. In a 
word frame puzzle, the hidden words are arranged in a rectangular frame, reather 
than in a single straight line. Consider the two sample word frame puzzles 
below:

<P>The solver must locate words from a given wordlist hidden in the puzzle 
diagram in the form of a rectangular frame parallel to the sides of the puzzle 
(a <EM>word frame</EM>). Only words appearing in the puzzle in a word frame 
count (finding the letters of a word in a straight line or in any other 
rectilinear pattern is not considered to be the discovery of a hidden word). 
Word frames may be nested or overlap within a puzzle. Once all word frames have 
been located and all words not appearing in the puzzle have been discarded, the 
<EM>frozen letters</EM> letters that are not part of any word block) must be 
indicated on a line-by-line basis. Note that any letters surrounded by a word 
frame are also considered frozen unless they are part of some other word block. 
Write a program that will solve word frame puzzles. 
<P>
<H3>Input</H3>The input file will contain a series of datasets in standard 
textfile format. Each dataset will consist of a puzzle (15 lines of 15 
characters), an integer representing the size of the wordlist on the sixteenth 
line, and the wordlist itself (one word per line) beginning on the seventeenth 
line. No word in the wordlist will be longer than 20 characters and all words 
which are hidden in the puzzle and wordlist will be in uppercase. There will be 
no intervening whitespace or extraneous characters. There are an unknown number 
of datasets in the input file. Your program must process all datasets in the 
file. 
<P>
<H3>Output</H3>The output from this program will show the results of solving 
each puzzle. Each result should be labeled with a puzzle number, beginning with 
1. These should be followed by a list of words from the wordlist which do not 
appear in the puzzle in the form of a word frame. Following the list of unused 
words will be a line-by-line listing of the frozen letters (from left to right). 
If a row contains no frozen letters, it will appear in the frozen letters list 
with no letters indicated. Several blank lines should separate the results from 
each dataset. Refer to the example for the acceptable output format for this 
problem.
