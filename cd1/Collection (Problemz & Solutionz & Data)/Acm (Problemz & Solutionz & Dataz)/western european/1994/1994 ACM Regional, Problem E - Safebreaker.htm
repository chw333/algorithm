<H4>1994-1995 ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest<BR>Western 
European Regional</H4>
<H1>Problem E </H1>
<H2>Safebreaker </H2></CENTER>We are observing someone playing the game of 
Mastermind. The object of this game is to find a secret code by intelligent 
guess work, assisted by some clues. In this case the secret code is a 4-digit 
number in the inclusive range from 0000 to 9999, say "3321". The player makes a 
first random guess, say "1223" and then, as for each of the future guesses, gets 
a clue telling him how good his guess is. A clue consists of two numbers: the 
number of correct digits (in this case 1: the "2" at the third position) and the 
additional number of digits guessed correctly but in the wrong place (in this 
case 2: the "1" and the "3"). The clue would in this case be: "1/2". 
<P>Write a program that given a set of guesses and corresponding clues, tries to 
find the secret code. 
<H3>Input</H3>The first line of input specifies the number of test cases 
(<EM>N</EM>) your program has to process. Each test case consists of a first 
line containing the number of guesses <EM>G</EM> (0 &lt;= <EM>G</EM> &lt;= 10), 
and <EM>G</EM> subsequent lines consisting of exactly 8 characters: a code of 
four digits, a blank, a digit indicating the number of correct digits, a '/' and 
a digit indicating the number of correct but misplaced digits. 
<H3>Output</H3>For each test case, the output contains a single line saying 
either: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <DL>
    <DT><CODE>impossible</CODE> 
    <DD>if there is no code consistent with all guesses. 
    <DT><EM>the secret code</EM> 
    <DD>if there is exactly one code consistent with all guesses. 
    <DT><CODE>indeterminate</CODE> 
    <DD>if there is more than one code which is consistent with all guesses.
