<H1>Problem D </H1>
<H2>Divisors </H2></CENTER>Mathematicians love all sorts of odd properties of 
numbers. For instance, they consider 945 to be an interesting number, since it 
is the first odd number for which the sum of its divisors is larger than the 
number itself.
<P>To help them search for interesting numbers, you are to write a program that 
scans a range of numbers and determines the number that has the largest number 
of divisors in the range. Unfortunately, the size of the numbers, and the size 
of the range is such that a too simple-minded approach may take too much time to 
run. So make sure that your algorithm is clever enough to cope with the largest 
possible range in just a few seconds. 
<P>
<H3>Input</H3>The first line of input specifies the number <EM>N</EM> of ranges, 
and each of the <EM>N</EM> following lines contains a range, consisting of a 
lower bound <EM>L</EM> and an upper bound <EM>U</EM>, where <EM>L</EM> and 
<EM>U</EM> are included in the range. <EM>L</EM> and <EM>U</EM> are chosen such 
that (1 &lt;= <EM>L</EM> &lt;=<EM>U</EM> &lt;= 1,000,000,000) and (0 &lt;= 
<EM>U</EM>-<EM>L</EM> &lt;= 10,000). 
<H3>Output</H3>For each range, find the number <EM>P</EM> which has the largest 
number of divisors (if several numbers tie for first place, select the lowest), 
and the number of positive divisors <EM>D</EM> of <EM>P</EM> (where <EM>P</EM> 
is included as a divisor). Print the text '<CODE>Between <EM>L</EM> and 
<EM>H</EM>, <EM>P</EM> has a maximum of <EM>D</EM> divisors.</CODE>', where 
<EM>L</EM>, <EM>H</EM>, <EM>P</EM>, and <EM>D</EM> are the numbers as defined 
above. <A href="http://www.karrels.org/Ed/ACM/weur94/prob_c.c">
