<H4>1994-1995 ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest<BR>Western 
European Regional</H4>
<H1>Problem E </H1>
<H2>Fatman </H2></CENTER>Some of us may be so fortunate to be thin enough to 
squeeze through the tiniest hole, others are not. Getting from A to B in a 
crowded supermarket (even without a cart) can be tough and may require 
sophisticated navigation: there may seem to be enough room on the one side, but 
then you may run into trouble with that lady further down...
<P>Let's consider this in an abstract fashion: given an aisle of a certain 
width, with infinitely small obstacles scattered around, just how fat can a 
person be and still be able to get from the left side to the right side. Assume 
that seen from above a (fat) person looks like a circle and the person is 
incompressible (a person with diameter d cannot go between two obstacles having 
distance less than d). 
<P>
<H3>Input</H3>The first line of input specifies the number of test cases your 
program has to process. The input for each test case consists of the following 
lines: 
<UL>
  <LI>One line with the integer length <EM>L</EM> (0 &lt;= <EM>L</EM> &lt;= 100) 
  and integer width <EM>W</EM> (0 &lt;= <EM>W</EM> &lt;= 100) of the aisle, 
  separated by a single space. 
  <LI>One line with the number of obstacles <EM>N</EM> (0 &lt;= <EM>N</EM> &lt;= 
  100) in the aisle. 
  <LI><EM>N</EM> lines, one for each obstacle, with its integer coordinates 
  <EM>X</EM> and <EM>Y</EM> (0 &lt;= <EM>X</EM> &lt;= <EM>L</EM>, <EM>0</EM> 
  &lt;= <EM>Y</EM> &lt;= <EM>W</EM>) separated by a single space. </LI></UL>
<H3>Output</H3>For each test case given in the input, print a line saying 
'<CODE>Maximum size in test case <EM>N</EM> is <EM>M</EM>.</CODE>', where 
<EM>M</EM> is rounded to the nearest fractional part of exactly four digits. 
<EM>M</EM> is the maximum diameter of a person that can get through the aisle 
specified for that test case. <EM>N</EM> is the current test case number, 
starting at one.
