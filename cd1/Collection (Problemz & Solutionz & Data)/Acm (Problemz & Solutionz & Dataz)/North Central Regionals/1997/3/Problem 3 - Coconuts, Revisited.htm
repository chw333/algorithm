<P>The short story titled <EM>Coconuts</EM>, by Ben Ames Williams, appeared in 
the <EM>Saturday Evening Post</EM> on October 9, 1926. The story tells about 
five men and a monkey who were shipwrecked on an island. They spent the first 
night gathering coconuts. During the night, one man woke up and decided to take 
his share of the coconuts. He divided them into five piles. One coconut was left 
over so he gave it to the monkey, then hid his share and went back to sheep. 
<P>Soon a second man woke up and did the same thing. After dividing the coconuts 
into five piles, one coconut was left over which he gave to the monkey. He then 
hid his share and went back to bed. The third, fourth, and fifth man followed 
exactly the same procedure. The next morning, after they all woke up, they 
divided the remaining coconuts into five equal shares. This time no coconuts 
were left over. 
<P>An obvious question is "how many coconuts did they originally gather?" There 
are an infinite number of answers, but the lowest of these is 3,121. But that's 
not our problem here. 
<P>Suppose we turn the problem around. If we know the number of coconuts that 
were gathered, what is the maximum number of persons (and one monkey) that could 
have been shipwrecked if the same procedure could occur? 
<P>
<H3>Input</H3>The input will consist of a sequence of integers, each 
representing the number of coconuts gathered by a group of persons (and a 
monkey) that were shipwrecked. The sequence will be followed by a negative 
number. 
<P>
<H3>Output</H3>For each number of coconuts, determine the largest number of 
persons who could have participated in the procedure described above. Display 
the results similar to the manner shown below, in the Expected Output. There may 
be no solution for some of the input cases; if so, state that observation.
