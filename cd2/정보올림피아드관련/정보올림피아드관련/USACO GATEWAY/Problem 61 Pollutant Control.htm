<P>It's your first day in Quality Control at Merry Milk Makers, and already 
there's been a catastrophe. You've discovered that a shipment of bad milk has 
been sent out. Unfortunately, you didn't discover this until the milk was 
already into your delivery system, a rather large and complex affair. You do, 
however, know which grocer that milk was destined for, but there may be multiple 
ways for the milk to get to that store. 
<P>The delivery system is made up of a several warehouses, with trucks running 
from warehouse to warehouse moving milk. While the milk will be found quickly, 
it is important that it does not make it to the grocer, so you must shut down 
enough trucks to ensure that it is impossible for the milk to get to the grocer 
in question. Every route costs a certain amount to shut down. Find the minimum 
amount that must be spent to ensure the milk does not reach its destination, 
along with a set of trucks to shut down that achieves this goal at that cost.

<H3>INPUT FORMAT</H3>
<TABLE border=1>
  <TBODY>
  <TR>
    <TD>Line 1: </TD>
    <TD>Two space separated integers, N and M. N (2 &lt;= N &lt;= 32) is the 
      number of warehouses that Merry Milk Makers has, and M (0 &lt;= M &lt;= 
      1000) is the number of trucks routes run. Warehouse 1 is actually the 
      productional facility, while warehouse N is the grocer to which which the 
      bad milk was destined. </TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Line 2..M+1: </TD>
    <TD>Truck routes: three space-separated integers, S<SUB>i</SUB>, 
      E<SUB>i</SUB>, and C<SUB>i</SUB>. S<SUB>i</SUB> and E<SUB>i</SUB> (1 &lt;= 
      S<SUB>i</SUB>,E<SUB>i</SUB> &lt;= N) correspond to the pickup warehouse 
      and dropoff warehouse for the truck route. C<SUB>i</SUB> (0 &lt;= 
      C<SUB>i</SUB> &lt;= 2,000,000) is the cost of shutting down the truck 
      route. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

<H3>OUTPUT FORMAT</H3>
<P>The first line of the output should be two integers, C and T. C is the 
minimum amount which must be spent in order to ensure the our milk never reaches 
its destination. T is the minimum number of truck routes that you plan to shut 
down in order to achive this goal. The next T lines sould contain the truck 
routes that you suggest shutting down. If there are multiple sets of truck 
routes that achieve the goal at minimum cost, choose one that shuts down the 
minimum number of routes.
