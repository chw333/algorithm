<P>Three farmers rise at 5 am each morning and head for the barn to milk three 
cows. The first farmer begins milking his cow at time 300 (measured in seconds 
after 5 am) and ends at time 1000. The second farmer begins at time 700 and ends 
at time 1200. The third farmer begins at time 1500 and ends at time 2100. The 
longest continuous time during which at least one farmer was milking a cow was 
900 seconds (from 300 to 1200). The longest time no milking was done, between 
the beginning and the ending of all milking, was 300 seconds (1500 minus 1200). 
<P>Your job is to write a program that will examine a list of beginning and 
ending times for N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 5000) farmers milking N cows and compute (in 
seconds): 
<UL>
  <LI>The longest time interval at least one cow was milked. 
  <LI>The longest time interval no cows were being milked. </LI></UL>
