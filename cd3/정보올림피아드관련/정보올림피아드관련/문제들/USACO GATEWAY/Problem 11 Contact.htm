<P>The cows have developed a new interest in scanning the universe outside their 
farm with radiotelescopes. Recently, they noticed a very curious microwave 
pulsing emission sent right from the centre of the galaxy. They wish to know if 
the emission is transmitted by some extraterrestrial form of intelligent life or 
if it is nothing but the usual heartbeat of the stars. 
<P>Help the cows to find the Truth by providing a tool to analyze bit patterns 
in the files they record. They are seeking bit patterns of length <B>A</B> 
through <B>B</B> inclusive (1 &lt;= A &lt;= B &lt;= 12) that repeat themselves 
most often in each day's data file. They are looking for the patterns that 
repeat themselves most often. An input limit tells how many of the most frequent 
patterns to output. 
<P>Pattern occurrences may overlap, and only patterns that occur at least once 
are taken into account.

<P>In this example, pattern 100 occurs 12 times, and pattern 1000 occurs 5 
times. The most frequent pattern is 00, with 23 occurrences. 
<H3>OUTPUT FORMAT</H3>
<P>Lines that list the N highest frequencies (in descending order of frequency) 
along with the patterns that occur in those frequencies. Order those patterns by 
shortest-to-longest and increasing binary number for those of the same 
frequency. If fewer than N highest frequencies are available, print only those 
that are. 
<P>Print the frequency alone by itself on a line. Then print the actual patterns 
space separated, six to a line (unless fewer than six remain).
