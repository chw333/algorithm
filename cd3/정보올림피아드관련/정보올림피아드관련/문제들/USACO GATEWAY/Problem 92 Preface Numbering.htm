<P>A certain book's prefaces are numbered in upper case Roman numerals. 
Traditional Roman numeral values use a single letter to represent a certain 
subset of decimal numbers. Here is the standard set: <PRE>        I   1     L   50    M  1000
        V   5     C  100
        X  10     D  500
</PRE>
<P>As many as three of the same marks that represent 10<SUP>n</SUP> may be 
placed consecutively to form other numbers: 
<UL>
  <LI>III is 3 
  <LI>CCC is 300 </LI></UL>
<P>Marks that have the value 5x10<SUP>n</SUP> are never used consecutively. 
<P>Generally (with the exception of the next rule), marks are connected together 
and written in descending order to form even more numbers: 
<UL></UL>
<LI>CCLXVIII = 100+100+50+10+5+1+1+1 = 268 
<UL></UL>
<P>Sometimes, a mark that represents 10^n is placed before a mark of one of the 
two next higher values (I before V or X; X before L or C; etc.). In this case, 
the value of the smaller mark is SUBTRACTED from the mark it precedes: 
<UL>
  <LI>IV = 4 
  <LI>IX = 9 
  <LI>XL = 40 </LI></UL>
<P>Compound marks like XD, IC, and XM are not legal, since the smaller mark is 
too much smaller than the larger one. For XD (wrong for 490), one would use 
CDXC; for IC (wrong for 99), one would use XCIX; for XM (wrong for 990), one 
would use CMXC. 
<P>Given N (1 &lt;= N &lt; 3,500), the number of pages in the preface of a book, 
calculate and print the number of I's, V's, etc. (in order from lowest to 
highest) required to typeset all the page numbers (in Roman numerals) from 1 
through N. Do not print letters that do not appear in the page numbers 
specified. 
<P>If N = 5, then the page numbers are: I, II, III, IV, V. The total number of 
I's is 7 and the total number of V's is 2. 
<H3>PROGRAM NAME: preface</H3>
<H3>INPUT FORMAT</H3>A single line containing the integer N. 
<H3>SAMPLE INPUT (file preface.in) </H3><PRE>5
</PRE>
<H3>OUTPUT FORMAT</H3>The output lines specify, in ascending order of Roman 
numeral letters, the letter, a single space, and the number of times that letter 
appears on preface page numbers. Stop printing letter totals after printing the 
highest value letter used to form preface numbers in the specified set.
