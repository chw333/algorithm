<P>In a wireless network with multiple transmitters sending on the same 
frequencies, it is often a requirement that signals don't overlap, or at least 
that they don't conflict. One way of accomplishing this is to restrict a 
transmitter's coverage area. This problem uses a shielded transmitter that only 
broadcasts in a semicircle. </P>
<P>A transmitter <I>T</I> is located somewhere on a 1,000 square meter grid. It 
broadcasts in a semicircular area of radius <I>r</I>. The transmitter may be 
rotated any amount, but not moved. Given <I>N</I> points anywhere on the grid, 
compute the maximum number of points that can be simultaneously reached by the 
transmitter's signal. Figure 1 shows the same data points with two different 
transmitter rotations. </P>
<CENTER><IMG src="Problem A Transmitters.files/transmit2.gif"></CENTER>
<P>All input coordinates are integers (0-1000). The radius is a positive real 
number greater than 0. Points on the boundary of a semicircle are considered 
within that semicircle. There are 1-150 unique points to examine per 
transmitter. No points are at the same location as the transmitter. </P>
<P>Input consists of information for one or more independent transmitter 
problems. Each problem begins with one line containing the (x,y) coordinates of 
the transmitter followed by the broadcast radius, <I>r</I>. The next line 
contains the number of points <I>N</I> on the grid, followed by <I>N</I> sets of 
(x,y) coordinates, one set per line. The end of the input is signalled by a line 
with a negative radius; the (x,y) values will be present but indeterminate. 
Figures 1 and 2 represent the data in the first two example data sets below, 
though they are on different scales. Figures 1a and 2 show transmitter rotations 
that result in maximal coverage. </P>
<P>For each transmitter, the output contains a single line with the maximum 
number of points that can be contained in some semicircle. </P><!-- <br><br><br><BR><BR><BR><BR><br><br><br><BR><BR><BR><BR><br><br> -->
