<h1>Duck!</h1>

<h3>input file: <code>duck.in</code></h3>

<p>The people of Bumpus (Bumpkins) are a fun, happy,
peace-loving people who have a big problem.  
They have very little depth perception and are constantly running into
doors.   They've asked you to write a
program to let them know when they should duck going through a doorway.
Since Bumpkins love fun, some of their
doorways have been made intentionally short to force other Bumpkins to either
crawl or limbo through the door.  
Unfortunately, the Bumpkins don't all use the same set of measurements,
so some heights are measured in inches, others in feet, others in yards, others
in centimeters, and others in meters.  
To do the conversions, recall that:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 inch = 2.54
centimeters</li>
<li>1 foot =
12 inches</li>
<li>1 yard = 3 feet</li>
<li>1 meter =
100 centimeters</li>
</ul>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>The input file will begin with a single line, telling you
how many Bumpkins want help.   Then, for
each Bumpkin, there will be data about the Bumpkin and the doorways they
reach.   The first line of each dataset
will give you the Bumpkin's name (all Bumpkins have names of exactly 6
characters), an integer <i>n</i>, the number of doors to process for this
Bumpkin (<i>n</i> &gt; 0), and the Bumpkin's height, a floating point number
followed by exactly one blank and then one of 'i',
'f',
'y',
'c',
or 'm'
(representing inches, feet, yards, centimeters, and meters).
The next <i>n</i> lines will have the height
of the doorways in the bumpkin's life, one per line.
Each height will be a floating point number followed by exactly
one blank and one of
'i',
'f',
'y',
'c',
or 'm'
(representing inches, feet, yards, centimeters, and meters).</p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p>For each Bumpkin, print the name of the Bumpkin on one line
and then for each door, print the way the Bumpkin should travel through the
door.   Decide on a mode of travel based
on the table below, where <i>b</i> is the height of the Bumpkin, <i>d</i> is
the height of the door (expressed in the same units):</p>
