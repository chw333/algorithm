<P align=justify>You must have heard of the Josephus problem in connection with 
link lists. It dealt with finding the only survivor among <I>n</I> persons. Here 
you have a game with a rather happy outcome. Suppose <I>n</I> players stand in a 
circle. Counting from player number 1 every alternate player is temporarily 
removed (for example, at first 2 is removed) to finally end up with the single 
survivor. After the survivor has been determined each player with number higher 
than the survivor is paid Tk. 1 and permanently removed from the circle. The 
same operation is repeated with the remaining players, and players with number 
higher than the survivor are paid Tk. 1 each and removed from the circle again. 
Once such an operation fails to decrease the number of players in the circle, 
each of them is paid Tk. 2 and the game ends. Your problem is to determine total 
amount of money Josephus will have to pay to all players. </P><IMG

<P align=justify>For example, with 5 players in the first round survivor is 3, 
so players number 4 and 5 are paid Taka 1 each and removed from the game. In the 
next round survivor is player number 3 again. Consequently no one could be 
removed, therefore each of them is paid Taka 2, so in total (2 + 2 x 3 =) 8 will 
be paid for this game.</P>
