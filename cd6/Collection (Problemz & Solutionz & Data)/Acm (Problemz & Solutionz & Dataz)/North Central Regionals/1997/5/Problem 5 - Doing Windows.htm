Windows -- Problem 5</FONT></STRONG> </CENTER>
<P>The screen of monitors on computer systems are rectangles. The <EM>aspect 
ratio</EM> of a screen is its width divided by its height. This term can also be 
applied to rectangular windows that may appear on the monitor's screen, where it 
is defined as the width of the window divided by its height. For this problem we 
assume the dimensions of a monitor's screen and its windows are measured in 
integral numbers of pixels, the individual dots (arranged in a rectangular grid) 
that comprise and image. 
<P>Suppose your windowing software only allows windows to be resized in such a 
way that their aspect ratios are unmodified. For example, a window with a width 
of 150 pixels and a height of 100 pixels (and an espect ratio of 150/100, or 
1.5) can be resized so its width is 225 pixels and its height is 150 pixels (the 
aspect ratio remains unchanged, at 225/150, or 1.5), but a width of 224 and a 
height of 150 is not allowed, since that would change the aspect ratio. Each 
window can be moved to an arbitrary location on the screen, but the entire 
window must remain visible on the screen. 
<P>Given the size of a screen and the initial sizes of four different windows 
(as integer values for width and height), is it possible to resize (and 
relocate) the four windows so they completely cover the screen without 
overlapping each other? That's the question you are to answer in this problem. 
<P>For example, consider a square screen with four square windows. The aspect 
ratio for each of these is exactly 1. We are permitted to resize each of the 
four windows so they would completely fill the screen without overlapping. This 
case is illustrated by the first data set in the Sample Input, below. 
<P>
<H3>Input</H3>Input will consist of one or more data sets followed by a pair of 
zeroes. Each data set will contain five pairs of integers. The first pair 
(<EM>W</EM><SUB><EM>s</EM></SUB>, <EM>H</EM><SUB><EM>s</EM></SUB>) specifies the 
width and height of the screen. The four remaining pairs 
(<EM>W</EM><SUB><EM>i</EM></SUB>, <EM>H</EM><SUB><EM>i</EM></SUB>, for i = 1 to 
4) specify the initial sizes of the windows. 
<H3>Output</H3>Output should have one line for each input data set. The line 
should contain the input data set number (starting with 1) followed by the word 
<CODE>Yes</CODE> if the screen can be completely covered by the (possibly 
resized and relocated) windows with no overlap, or <CODE>No</CODE> if it cannot 
be so covered.
