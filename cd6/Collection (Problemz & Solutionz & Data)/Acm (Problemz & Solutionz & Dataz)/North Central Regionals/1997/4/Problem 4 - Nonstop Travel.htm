<P>Fast Phil works the late shift and leaves his company's parking lot at 
precisely 2:00 AM every morning. His route home is by a straight road which has 
one or more traffic signals. Phil has always wondered if, given the locations 
and cycles of each of the traffic signals, are there velocities he can travel 
home without ever having to speed up or slow down on account of a red light. You 
are to write a program to satisfy his curiosity. 
<P>Your program should find all integer speeds (in miles per hour) which can be 
used for Phil's trip home. Each speed is a rate (in miles per hour) he can 
maintain the moment he leaves the parking lot at 2:00 AM until he arrives home 
(we assume Phil has a long driveway in which to decelerate) such that he never 
passes through a red signal. He is allowed to pass throgh a signal at the exact 
moment it turns from yellow to red, or at the exact moment a red signal turns 
green. Since Phil is a relatively law-abiding citizen, you need only consider 
speeds less than or equal to 60 mph. Likewise, Phil isn't interested in 
travelling too slowly, so you should not consider speeds lower than 30 mph. 
<P>
<H3>Input</H3>Input will consist of one or more sets of data describing a set of 
traffic signals, followed by the integer -1. The first integer in each set will 
contain the value <EM>N</EM> (specifying the number of traffic signals). 
<EM>N</EM> will be no larger than 6. This value will be followed by <EM>N</EM> 
sets of numbers, each containing values (in order) for <EM>L</EM>, <EM>G</EM>, 
<EM>Y</EM> and <EM>R</EM>. <EM>L</EM> is a positive real number indicating the 
location of a traffic signal, in miles, from the parking lot. <EM>G</EM>, 
<EM>Y</EM> and <EM>R</EM> are the lengths of time (in seconds) of the green, 
yellow, and red periods of the corresponding traffic signal's cycle. Phil has 
learned from an informant in the Highway Department that all <EM>N</EM> traffic 
signals start their green period precisely at 2:00 AM. 
<P>
<H3>Output</H3>Output should consist of the input case number (starting with 1) 
followed by a list of all valid integer speeds Phil may drive to avoid the red 
signals. Consecutive integer speeds should be specified in interval notation of 
the form <EM><CODE>L-H</CODE></EM>, where <EM><CODE>L</CODE></EM> and 
<EM><CODE>H</CODE></EM> are the lowest and highest speeds for the interval. 
Intervals of the form <EM><CODE>L-L</CODE></EM> (that is, an interval of length 
1) shold just be written as <EM><CODE>L</CODE></EM>. Intervals should be 
separated by commas. If there are no valid speeds, you program should display 
the phrase <EM><CODE>No acceptable speeds.</CODE></EM> The Expected Output below 
illustrates this format.
