The Hiker</H1>

<H2>
Background</H2>
Bill is a passionate hiker. Every summer he wants to hike through a forest
which he hasn't seen before. Therefore he gathers information about different
forests. Bill has developed his own ideas when to appreciate a forest:
In the forest Bill wants to camp out on a clearing. When the sun rises,
he starts his hiking-tour through the forest until he reaches the next
clearing in the evening. There he eats some beans and sets up his camp
again. Every day he continues his tour until he has camped on every clearing
at least once.

<P>At the end of his hiking tour he wants to arrive at the clearing he
started from and wants to have traveled on every path of the forest exactly
once. Between two clearings there are no two different direct paths.
<H2>
The Problem</H2>
For a given set of forests your program has to check which forests fit
to Bill's preferences. If a forest fits, show one tour through the forest.
If there are several different possible tours use the following rules for
deciding which tour your program should choose: Start at the clearing with
the smallest identifier (every clearing is assigned an integer identifier).
For every clearing with alternatives (within correct tours) Bill chooses
the one with the smallest identifier.
<H2>
The Input</H2>
The first line contains the number of forests to check. For each forest
the input contains the number of paths (less than 1000) followed by one
line for each path. A path is given by two positive integer values separated
by a space, which are identifiers for the clearings. The maximum number
of clearings is 1000.
<H2>
The Output</H2>
Your program shall output one line for each forest. If there is no possible
hiking tour for Bill write <TT>no</TT> in the output. Otherwise print one
course as it is specified above: Print the identifiers of the clearings
in the tour in one line separated by a space. The last clearing must be
identical to the first clearing.
