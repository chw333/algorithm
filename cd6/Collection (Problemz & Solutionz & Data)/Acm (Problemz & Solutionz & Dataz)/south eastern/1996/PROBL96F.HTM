Write a program to compute the final standing by using the following rules:</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Teams are ranked according to the most problems solved. Teams who have solved the same number of problems are ranked by least total time. The total time is the sum of the time consumed for each problem solved. The time consumed for a solved problem is the time ellapsed from the beginning of the contest to the submital of the accepted run plus 20 minutes for each rejected run.
