<H1>Problem D </H1>
<H2>Block Voting </H2></CENTER>Different types of electoral systems exist. In a 
<EM>block voting</EM> system the members of a party do not vote individually as 
they like, but instead they must <STRONG>collectively</STRONG> accept or reject 
a proposal. Although a party with many votes clearly has more power than a party 
with few votes, the votes of a small party can nevertheless be crucial when they 
are needed to obtain a majority. Consider for example the following five-party 
system: 
<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE border=2>
  <TBODY>
  <TR>
    <TD align=middle><STRONG>party</STRONG> 
    <TD align=middle><STRONG>votes</STRONG> 
  <TR>
    <TD align=middle>A 
    <TD align=middle>7 
  <TR>
    <TD align=middle>B 
    <TD align=middle>4 
  <TR>
    <TD align=middle>C 
    <TD align=middle>2 
  <TR>
    <TD align=middle>D 
    <TD align=middle>6 
  <TR>
    <TD align=middle>E 
    <TD align=middle>6 </TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER>
<P>Coalition {<EM>A</EM>, <EM>B</EM>} has 7 + 4 = 11 votes, which is not a 
majority. When party C joins coalition {<EM>A</EM>, <EM>B</EM>}, however, 
{<EM>A</EM>, <EM>B</EM>, <EM>C</EM>} becomes a winning coalition with 7+4+2 = 13 
votes. So even though C is a small party, it can play an important role. 
<P>As a measure of a party's power in a block voting system, John F. Banzhaf III 
proposed to use the <EM>power index</EM>.<SUP><A 
href="http://www.karrels.org/Ed/ACM/weur95/prob_d.html#foot1">1</A></SUP> The 
key idea is that a party's power is determined by the number of minority 
coalitions that it can join and turn into a (winning) majority coalition. Note 
that the empty coalition is also a minority coalition and that a coalition only 
forms a majority when it has more than half of the total number of votes. In the 
example just given, a majority coalition must have at least 13 votes. 
<P>In an ideal system, a party's power index is proportional to the number of 
members of that party. 
<P>Your task is to write a program that, given an input as shown above, computes 
for each party its power index. 
<P>
<H3>Input Specification </H3>The first line contains a single integer which 
equals the number of test cases that follow. Each of the following lines 
contains one test case. 
<P>The first number on a line contains an integer <EM>P</EM> in [1...20] which 
equals the number of parties for that test case. This integer is followed by 
<EM>P</EM> positive integers, separated by spaces. Each of these integers 
represents the number of members of a party in the electoral system. The 
<EM>i</EM>-th number represents party number <EM>i</EM>. No electoral system has 
more than 1000 votes. 
<P>
<H3>Output Specification </H3>For each test case, you must generate <EM>P</EM> 
lines of output, followed by one empty line. <EM>P</EM> is the number of parties 
for the test case in question. The <EM>i</EM>-th line (<EM>i</EM> in 
[1...<EM>P</EM>]) contains the sentence: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>party <EM>i</EM> has power index <EM>I</EM>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>where <EM>I</EM> is the power index of party <EM>i</EM>. 
<P>
<H3>Example Input </H3><PRE>3
5 7 4 2 6 6
6 12 9 7 3 1 1
3 2 1 1
</PRE>
<H3>Example Output </H3><PRE>party 1 has power index 10
party 2 has power index 2
party 3 has power index 2
party 4 has power index 6
party 5 has power index 6
party 1 has power index 18
party 2 has power index 14
party 3 has power index 14
party 4 has power index 2
party 5 has power index 2
party 6 has power index 2
party 1 has power index 3
party 2 has power index 1
party 3 has power index 1
