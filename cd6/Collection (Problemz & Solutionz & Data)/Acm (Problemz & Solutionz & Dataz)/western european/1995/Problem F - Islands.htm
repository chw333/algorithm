<H3>1995-1996 ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest<BR>Western 
European Regional</H3>
<H1>Problem F </H1>
<H2>Islands </H2></CENTER>Now that the Eurotunnel between France and Great 
Britain is in operation, the French government is thinking about a new project 
to expand the connections with their British neighbors. Inspired by the movie 
"Bridges of Madison County," their prime architect Clouseau has been working on 
a plan to connect France to the Channel Islands by building a number of bridges. 

<P>To minimize the costs of the bridges, a necessity to get the plan approved, 
Clouseau has been working hard to find the best places to build the bridges that 
connect the islands to France. He has figured out that connecting each island to 
France individually is not the cheapest solution; it is cheaper to construct a 
bridge between one island and France, and build additional bridges to connect 
the other islands indirectly. Clouseau, however, is unable to find the best 
places to build the bridges because of the irregular shapes of the islands. 
<P>By approximating the islands as circles, Clouseau was able to report his 
boss, Mr. Dreyfus, an estimate of the length of the interconnecting bridges. Mr. 
Dreyfus, however, is not satisfied and demands that Clouseau report by Monday 
the <EM>exact</EM> length of the bridges needed based on the actual shapes of 
the Channel Islands. If Clouseau does not report on time he will be fired. Would 
you be so kind to help out Clouseau and write a program that computes the 
minimum length of the bridges needed to interconnect the Channel Islands? 
<P>
<H3>Input Specification </H3>The first line of input contains the number of test 
cases. A test case consists of one line holding the number of islands (2 &lt;= 
<EM>N</EM> &lt;= 100), followed by <EM>N</EM> lines that describe the islands. 
An island is a polygon, which is described as a number (1 &lt;= <EM>P</EM> &lt;= 
25) that gives the number of points followed by <EM>P</EM> pairs of coordinates. 
Each coordinate is an integer in the range [-1000...1000]. The points are listed 
in order such that by connecting consecutive points, and the last point to the 
first, the perimeter of the island is given. It is guaranteed that islands do 
not touch or intersect. 
<P>
<H3>Output Specification </H3>For each test case output one line reporting the 
minimal interconnect as follows: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>The minimal interconnect consists of <EM>N</EM> bridges with a total length of <EM>L</EM>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>Where <EM>N</EM> is the number of bridges, and <EM>L</EM> is 
the total length, which should be printed as a floating point number with an 
accuracy of three digits.
