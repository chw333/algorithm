<h1>Playing the Percentages</h1>

<h3>input file: <code>percent.in</code></h3>

<p>You will frequently see claims using percentages like:
&quot;56.3% of all Florida tourists prefer Daytona Beach!&quot;
But what do these claims <i>really</i> mean? 
In this program, you should determine the minimum sample size
necessary to give a given percentage with a given number of decimal digits.</p>

<p>For this problem, percentages are computed by taking an
integer divided by the sample size.   
For example, a percentage of 50% with 0 decimal digits could be obtained
from a sample size of just 2, since 1/2 = 50%, but a percentage of 51% with 0
decimal digits would need a sample size of 35, since to get a value that would
round to 51%, you need to use 18/35. No smaller sample size would give a
percentage of 51%.   Similarly, to get a
percentage of 50.0% with 1 decimal digit, a sample size of 2 would still
suffice, but it would take a sample size of 49 to get a percentage of
51.0% with one decimal digit.
You should follow standard rounding rules
where values of 5 and above round up to the next higher value and all others
round down.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>The input to your program will be a list of 1 or more data
sets where each data set consists of two numbers <i>d</i> and <i>p</i>.
<i>d</i>
is an integer, 0 &lt;= d</i> &lt;= 5, indicating the number
of significant decimal digits in the percentage, which is represented by 
<i>p</i>, 0 &lt; <i>p</i> &lt; 100, a floating point number.</p>

<p>The end of input will be indicated by the data set <code>0 0</code>.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p>For each line of input (except for the end of input
indicator line), your program should produce a line of output in the following
form:</p>

<code>
A minimum sample size of <i>n</i> is necessary for a percentage of <i>p</i>.
</code>

<p>where <i>n</i> is
replaced with the minimum sample size and <i>p</i>
is the input value <i>p</i>, with <i>d</i> decimal digits.</p>

<h3>Sample Input</h3>

<pre>
0 51
2 51.00
1 56.3
0 0
</pre>

<h3>Output corresponding to the Sample Input</h3>

<pre>
A minimum sample size of 35 is necessary for a percentage of 51.
A minimum sample size of 100 is necessary for a percentage of 51.00.
A minimum sample size of 16 is necessary for a percentage of 56.3.
