      <H2 align=center>Contest Problems and Introduction</H2>
      <P>Dear Contestants: 
      <P>We have prepared a&nbsp;set of very interesting real-life problems for 
      you. A&nbsp;team called Archaeologists of the Central Mountains (ACM) is 
      interested in the famous Helmut's Pyramid (HP) in Egypt. In the Pyramid, 
      there is a&nbsp;Sarcophagus of Umbertiti Nefrites (SUN). According to the 
      legend, the Sarcophagus contains (besides the pharaoh's body, of course) 
      a&nbsp;priceless treasure: air-tickets to Orlando, FL, with the magic date 
      March 2000. The ACM decided to locate this treasure and retrieve it from 
      the Pyramid before it is too late. The problem is that the Pyramid is 
      equipped with many varied traps to protect the tickets from being stolen. 
      Many years of intensive study have been spent monitoring activities inside 
      the Pyramid and discovering all the traps. Finally, the archaeologists are 
      ready to enter the Pyramid. They have a very powerful notebook to help 
      them finish their task. And your task is to provide the software for them. 

      <P>All programs you create should read data from standard input and write 
      the results to the standard output. No file operations are allowed. It is 
      important to follow the exact data format to prevent any 
      misunderstandings. The format is given for each problem. If not specified 
      otherwise, you can assume that: 
      <UL>
        <LI>if there is more than one number on the same line, they will be 
        separated by exactly one space 
        <LI>there will be no spaces at the ends of lines and no extra empty 
        lines 
        <LI>all the numbers in the input data and in the result will fit into 
        the standard integer type </LI></UL>
      <P>Well, that's about everything we have to say. Good luck with your 
      mission. 
      <P align=right>Your Organizing Team

      <H2 align=center>Run Away</H2>
      <P align=center>(<B>file name:</B> <CODE>away.c, away.p, away.C</CODE>) 
      <P>One of the traps we will encounter in the Pyramid is located in the 
      Large Room. A lot of small holes are drilled into the floor. They look 
      completely harmless at the first sight. But when activated, they start to 
      throw out very hot java, uh ... pardon, lava. Unfortunately, all known 
      paths to the Center Room (where the Sarcophagus is) contain a&nbsp;trigger 
      that activates the trap. The ACM were not able to avoid that. But they 
      have carefully monitored the positions of all the holes. So it is 
      important to find the place in the Large Room that has the maximal 
      distance from all the holes. This place is the safest in the entire room 
      and the archaeologist has to hide there. 
      <H3>Input Specification</H3>The input consists of <VAR>T</VAR> test cases. 
      The number of them (<VAR>T</VAR>) is given on the first line of the input 
      file. Each test case begins with a line containing three integers 
      <VAR>X</VAR>, <VAR>Y</VAR>, <VAR>M</VAR> separated by space. The numbers 
      satisfy conditions: <VAR>1 &lt;= X,Y &lt;=10000</VAR>, <VAR>1 &lt;= M 
      &lt;= 1000</VAR>. The numbers <VAR>X</VAR> and <VAR>Y</VAR>indicate the 
      dimensions of the Large Room which has a&nbsp;rectangular shape. The 
      number <VAR>M</VAR> stands for the number of holes. Then exactly 
      <VAR>M</VAR> lines follow, each containing two integer numbers 
      <VAR>U<SUB>i</SUB></VAR> and <VAR>V<SUB>i</SUB></VAR> (<VAR>0 &lt;= 
      U<SUB>i</SUB> &lt;= X</VAR>, <VAR>0 &lt;= V<SUB>i</SUB> &lt;= Y</VAR>) 
      indicating the coordinates of one hole. There may be several holes at the 
      same position. 
      <H3>Output Specification</H3>Print exactly one line for each test case. 
      The line should contain the sentence "<CODE>The safest point is 
      (<VAR>P</VAR>, <VAR>Q</VAR>).</CODE>" where <VAR>P</VAR> and 
      <VAR>Q</VAR>are the coordinates of the point in the room that has the 
      maximum distance from the nearest hole, rounded to the nearest number with 
      exactly one digit after the decimal point (0.05 rounds up to 0.1).

      <H2 align=center>Equipment Box</H2>
      <P align=center>(<B>file name:</B> <CODE>box.c, box.p, box.C</CODE>) 
      <P>There is a large room in the Pyramid called <EM>Room-of-No-Return</EM>. 
      Its floor is covered by rectangular tiles of equal size. The name of the 
      room was chosen because of the very high number of traps and mechanisms in 
      it. The ACM group has spent several years studying the secret plan of this 
      room. It has made a clever plan to avoid all the traps. A specially 
      trained mechanic was sent to deactivate the most feared trap called 
      Shattered Bones. After deactivating the trap the mechanic had to escape 
      from the room. It is very important to step on the center of the tiles 
      only; he must not touch the edges. One wrong step and a large rock falls 
      from the ceiling squashing the mechanic like a pancake. After deactivating 
      the trap, he realized a horrible thing: the ACM plan did not take his 
      equipment box into consideration. The box must be laid onto the ground 
      because the mechanic must have both hands free to prevent contact with 
      other traps. But when the box is laid on the ground, it could touch the 
      line separating the tiles. And this is the main problem you are to solve. 
      <H3>Input Specification</H3>The input consists of <VAR>T</VAR> test cases. 
      The number of them (<VAR>T</VAR>) is given on the first line of the input 
      file. Each test case consists of a single line. The line contains exactly 
      four integer numbers separated by spaces: <VAR>A</VAR>, <VAR>B</VAR>, 
      <VAR>X</VAR> and <VAR>Y</VAR>. <VAR>A</VAR> and <VAR>B</VAR>indicate the 
      dimensions of the tiles, <VAR>X</VAR> and <VAR>Y</VAR> are the dimensions 
      of the equipment box (<VAR>1 &lt;= A,B,X,Y &lt;= 50000</VAR>). 
      <H3>Output Specification</H3>Your task is to determine whether it is 
      possible to put the box on a&nbsp;single tile -- that is, if the whole box 
      fits on a&nbsp;single tile without touching its border. If so, you are to 
      print one line with the sentence "<CODE>Escape is possible.</CODE>". 
      Otherwise print the sentence "<CODE>Box cannot be dropped.</CODE>".

      <H2 align=center>Secret Code</H2>
      <P align=center>(<B>file name:</B> <CODE>code.c, code.p, code.C</CODE>) 
      <P>The Sarcophagus itself is locked by a secret numerical code. When 
      somebody wants to open it, he must know the code and set it exactly on the 
      top of the Sarcophagus. A very intricate mechanism then opens the cover. 
      If an incorrect code is entered, the tickets inside would catch fire 
      immediately and they would have been lost forever. The code (consisting of 
      up to 100 integers) was hidden in the Alexandrian Library but 
      unfortunately, as you probably know, the library burned down completely. 
      <P>But an almost unknown archaeologist has obtained a copy of the code 
      something during the 18th century. He was afraid that the code could get 
      to the ``wrong people'' so he has encoded the numbers in a very special 
      way. He took a random complex number <VAR>B</VAR> that was greater (in 
      absolute value) than any of the encoded numbers. Then he counted the 
      numbers as the digits of the system with basis <VAR>B</VAR>. That means 
      the sequence of numbers <VAR>a<SUB>n</SUB></VAR>, 
      <VAR>a<SUB>n-1</SUB></VAR>, ..., <VAR>a<SUB>1</SUB></VAR>, 
      <VAR>a<SUB>0</SUB></VAR> was encoded as the number <VAR>X = a<SUB>0</SUB> 
      + a<SUB>1</SUB>B + a<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUP>2</SUP> + ...+ 
      a<SUB>n</SUB>B<SUP>n</SUP></VAR>. 
      <P>Your goal is to decrypt the secret code, i.e. to express a given number 
      <VAR>X</VAR> in the number system to the base <VAR>B</VAR>. In other 
      words, given the numbers <VAR>X</VAR> and <VAR>B</VAR>you are to determine 
      the ``digit'' <VAR>a<SUB>0</SUB></VAR> through <VAR>a<SUB>n</SUB></VAR>. 
      <H3>Input Specification</H3>The input consists of <VAR>T</VAR> test cases. 
      The number of them (<VAR>T</VAR>) is given on the first line of the input 
      file. Each test case consists of one single line containing four integer 
      numbers <VAR>X<SUB>r</SUB></VAR>, X<SUB>i</SUB>, <VAR>B<SUB>r</SUB></VAR>, 
      <VAR>B<SUB>i</SUB></VAR> (<VAR>|X<SUB>r</SUB>|,|X<SUB>i</SUB>| &lt;= 
      1000000</VAR>, <VAR>|B<SUB>r</SUB>|,|B<SUB>i</SUB>| &lt;= 16</VAR>). These 
      numbers indicate the real and complex components of numbers <VAR>X</VAR> 
      and <VAR>B</VAR>, i.e. <VAR>X = X<SUB>r</SUB> + i.X<SUB>i</SUB></VAR>, 
      <VAR>B = B<SUB>r</SUB> + i.B<SUB>i</SUB></VAR>. <VAR>B</VAR> is the basis 
      of the system (<VAR>|B| &gt; 1</VAR>), <VAR>X</VAR> is the number you have 
      to express. 
      <H3>Output Specification</H3>Your program must output a single line for 
      each test case. The line should contain the ``digits'' 
      <VAR>a<SUB>n</SUB></VAR>, <VAR>a<SUB>n-1</SUB></VAR>, ..., 
      <VAR>a<SUB>1</SUB></VAR>, <VAR>a<SUB>0</SUB></VAR>, separated by commas. 
      The following conditions must be satisfied: 
      <UL>
        <LI>for all <VAR>i</VAR> in <VAR>{0, 1, 2, ...n}</VAR>: <VAR>0 &lt;= 
        a<SUB>i</SUB> &lt; |B|</VAR> 
        <LI><VAR>X = a<SUB>0</SUB> + a<SUB>1</SUB>B + a<SUB>2</SUB>B<SUP>2</SUP> 
        + ...+ a<SUB>n</SUB>B<SUP>n</SUP></VAR> 
        <LI>if <VAR>n &gt; 0</VAR> then <VAR>a<SUB>n</SUB> &lt;&gt; 0</VAR> 
        <LI><VAR>n &lt;= 100</VAR> </LI></UL>
      <P>If there are no numbers meeting these criteria, output the sentence 
      "<CODE>The code cannot be decrypted.</CODE>". If there are more 
      possibilities, print any of them.

      <H2 align=center>The Proper Key</H2>
      <P align=center>(<B>file name:</B> <CODE>key.c, key.p, key.C</CODE>) 
      <P>Many people think that Tetris was invented by two Russian programmers. 
      But that is not the whole truth. The idea of the game is very old -- even 
      the Egyptians had something similar. But they did not use it as a game. 
      Instead, it was used as a&nbsp;very complicated lock. The lock was made of 
      wood and consisted of a large number of square fields, laid out in regular 
      rows and columns. Each field was either completely filled with wood, or 
      empty. The key for this lock was two-dimensional and it was made by 
      joining square parts of the same size as the fields of the lock. So they 
      had a 2D lock and 2D key that could be inserted into the lock from the 
      top. The key was designed so that it was not possible to move it upwards. 
      It could only fall down and it could slide sideways -- exactly like in a 
      Tetris game. The only difference is that the key could not be rotated. 
      Rotation in Tetris is really a Russian invention. 
      <P>The entry gate into the Pyramid has such a lock. The ACM archaeologists 
      have found several keys and one of them belongs to the lock with a very 
      high probability. Now they need to try them out and find which one to use. 
      Because it is too time-consuming to try all of them, it is better to begin 
      with those keys that may be inserted deeper into the lock. Your program 
      should be able to determine how deep a given key can be inserted into a 
      given lock. 
      <H3>Input Specification</H3>The input consists of <VAR>T</VAR> test cases. 
      The number of them (<VAR>T</VAR>) is given on the first line of the input 
      file. Each test case begins with a line containing two integers 
      <VAR>R</VAR> and <VAR>C</VAR> (<VAR>1 &lt;= R,C &lt;= 100</VAR>) 
      indicating the key size. Then exactly <VAR>R</VAR> rows follow, each 
      containing <VAR>C</VAR> characters. Each character is either a hash mark 
      (<CODE>#</CODE>) or a period (<CODE>.</CODE>). A hash mark represents one 
      square field made of wood; a period is an empty field. The wooden fields 
      are always connected, i.e. the whole key is made of one piece. Moreover, 
      the key remains connected even if we cut off arbitrary number of rows from 
      its top. There is always at least one non-empty field in the top-most and 
      bottom-most rows and the left-most and right-most columns. 
      <P>After the key description, there is a line containing two integers 
      <VAR>D</VAR> and <VAR>W</VAR> (<VAR>1 &lt;= D &lt;= 10000</VAR>, <VAR>1 
      &lt;= W &lt;= 1000</VAR>). The number <VAR>W</VAR> is the lock width, and 
      <VAR>D</VAR> is its depth. The next <VAR>D</VAR> lines contain 
      <VAR>W</VAR> characters each. The character may be either a hash mark 
      (representing the wood) or a period (the free space). 
      <H3>Output Specification</H3>Your program should print one line of output 
      for each test case. The line should contain the statement "<CODE>The key 
      falls to depth <VAR>X</VAR>.</CODE>". Replace <VAR>X</VAR> with the 
      maximum depth to which the key can be inserted by moving it down and 
      sliding it to the left or right only. The depth is measured as the 
      distance between the bottom side of the key and the top side of the lock. 
      If it is possible to move the key through the whole lock and take it away 
      at the bottom side, output the sentence "<CODE>The key can fall 
      through.</CODE>".

      <P align=center>(<B>file name:</B> <CODE>labyrinth.c, labyrinth.p, 
      labyrinth.C</CODE>) 
      <P>The northern part of the Pyramid contains a very large and complicated 
      labyrinth. The labyrinth is divided into square blocks, each of them 
      either filled by rock, or free. There is also a little hook on the floor 
      in the center of every free block. The ACM have found that two of the 
      hooks must be connected by a rope that runs through the hooks in every 
      block on the path between the connected ones. When the rope is fastened, a 
      secret door opens. The problem is that we do not know which hooks to 
      connect. That means also that the neccessary length of the rope is 
      unknown. Your task is to determine the maximum length of the rope we could 
      need for a given labyrinth. 
      <H3>Input Specification</H3>The input consists of <VAR>T</VAR> test cases. 
      The number of them (<VAR>T</VAR>) is given on the first line of the input 
      file. Each test case begins with a line containing two integers 
      <VAR>C</VAR> and <VAR>R</VAR> (<VAR>3 &lt;= C,R &lt;= 1000</VAR>) 
      indicating the number of columns and rows. Then exactly <VAR>R</VAR> lines 
      follow, each containing <VAR>C</VAR> characters. These characters specify 
      the labyrinth. Each of them is either a hash mark (<CODE>#</CODE>) or a 
      period (<CODE>.</CODE>). Hash marks represent rocks, periods are free 
      blocks. It is possible to walk between neighbouring blocks only, where 
      neighbouring blocks are blocks sharing a&nbsp;common side. We cannot walk 
      diagonally and we cannot step out of the labyrinth. 
      <P>The labyrinth is designed in such a way that there is exactly one path 
      between any two free blocks. Consequently, if we find the proper hooks to 
      connect, it is easy to find the right path connecting them. 
      <H3>Output Specification</H3>Your program must print exactly one line of 
      output for each test case. The line must contain the sentence 
      "<CODE>Maximum rope length is <VAR>X</VAR>.</CODE>" where <VAR>X</VAR>is

      <H2 align=center>Piggy-Bank</H2>
      <P align=center>(<B>file name:</B> <CODE>pig.c, pig.p, pig.C</CODE>) 
      <P>Before ACM can do anything, a&nbsp;budget must be prepared and the 
      necessary financial support obtained. The main income for this action 
      comes from Irreversibly Bound Money (IBM). The idea behind is simple. 
      Whenever some ACM member has any small money, he takes all the coins and 
      throws them into a piggy-bank. You know that this process is irreversible, 
      the coins cannot be removed without breaking the pig. After a sufficiently 
      long time, there should be enough cash in the piggy-bank to pay everything 
      that needs to be paid. 
      <P>But there is a big problem with piggy-banks. It is not possible to 
      determine how much money is inside. So we might break the pig into pieces 
      only to find out that there is not enough money. Clearly, we want to avoid 
      this unpleasant situation. The only possibility is to weigh the piggy-bank 
      and try to guess how many coins are inside. Assume that we are able to 
      determine the weight of the pig exactly and that we know the weights of 
      all coins of a given currency. Then there is some minimum amount of money 
      in the piggy-bank that we can guarantee. Your task is to find out this 
      worst case and determine the minimum amount of cash inside the piggy-bank. 
      We need your help. No more prematurely broken pigs! 
      <H3>Input Specification</H3>The input consists of <VAR>T</VAR> test cases. 
      The number of them (<VAR>T</VAR>) is given on the first line of the input 
      file. Each test case begins with a line containing two integers 
      <VAR>E</VAR> and <VAR>F</VAR>. They indicate the weight of an empty pig 
      and of the pig filled with coins. Both weights are given in grams. No pig 
      will weigh more than 10 kg, that means <VAR>1 &lt;= E &lt;= F &lt;= 
      10000</VAR>. On the second line of each test case, there is an integer 
      number <VAR>N</VAR> (<VAR>1 &lt;= N &lt;= 500</VAR>) that gives the number 
      of various coins used in the given currency. Following this are exactly 
      <VAR>N</VAR> lines, each specifying one coin type. These lines contain two 
      integers each, <VAR>P</VAR>and <VAR>W</VAR> (<VAR>1 &lt;= P &lt;= 
      50000</VAR>, <VAR>1 &lt;= W &lt;=10000</VAR>). <VAR>P</VAR> is the value 
      of the coin in monetary units, <VAR>W</VAR> is it's weight in grams. 
      <H3>Output Specification</H3>Print exactly one line of output for each 
      test case. The line must contain the&nbsp;sentence "<CODE>The minimum 
      amount of money in the piggy-bank is <VAR>X</VAR>.</CODE>" where 
      <VAR>X</VAR> is the minimum amount of money that can be achieved using 
      coins with the given total weight. If the weight cannot be reached 
      exactly, print a&nbsp;line "<CODE>This is impossible.</CODE>".

      <H2 align=center>Lifting the Stone</H2>
      <P align=center>(<B>file name:</B> <CODE>stone.c, stone.p, stone.C</CODE>) 

      <P>There are many secret openings in the floor which are covered by a big 
      heavy stone. When the stone is lifted up, a special mechanism detects this 
      and activates poisoned arrows that are shot near the opening. The only 
      possibility is to lift the stone very slowly and carefully. The ACM team 
      must connect a rope to the stone and then lift it using a pulley. 
      Moreover, the stone must be lifted all at once; no side can rise before 
      another. So it is very important to find the centre of gravity and connect 
      the rope exactly to that point. The stone has a polygonal shape and its 
      height is the same throughout the whole polygonal area. Your task is to 
      find the centre of gravity for the given polygon. 
      <H3>Input Specification</H3>The input consists of <VAR>T</VAR> test cases. 
      The number of them (<VAR>T</VAR>) is given on the first line of the input 
      file. Each test case begins with a line containing a single integer 
      <VAR>N</VAR> (<VAR>3 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000000</VAR>) indicating the number of 
      points that form the polygon. This is followed by <VAR>N</VAR> lines, each 
      containing two integers <VAR>X<SUB>i</SUB></VAR> and 
      <VAR>Y<SUB>i</SUB></VAR> (<VAR>|X<SUB>i</SUB>|, |Y<SUB>i</SUB>| &lt;= 
      20000</VAR>). These numbers are the coordinates of the <VAR>i</VAR>-th 
      point. When we connect the points in the given order, we get a polygon. 
      You may assume that the edges never touch each other (except the 
      neighboring ones) and that they never cross. The area of the polygon is 
      never zero, i.e. it cannot collapse into a single line. 
      <H3>Output Specification</H3>Print exactly one line for each test case. 
      The line should contain exactly two numbers separated by one space. These 
      numbers are the coordinates of the centre of gravity. Round the 
      coordinates to the nearest number with exactly two digits after the 
      decimal point (0.005 rounds up to 0.01). Note that the centre of gravity 
      may be outside the polygon, if its shape is not convex. If there is such a 
      case in the input data, print the centre anyway.

      <H2 align=center>Play on Words</H2>
      <P align=center>(<B>file name:</B> <CODE>words.c, words.p, words.C</CODE>) 

      <P>Some of the secret doors contain a&nbsp;very interesting word puzzle. 
      The team of archaeologists has to solve it to open that doors. Because 
      there is no other way to open the doors, the puzzle is very important for 
      us. 
      <P>There is a&nbsp;large number of magnetic plates on every door. Every 
      plate has one word written on it. The plates must be arranged into a 
      sequence in such a way that every word begins with the same letter as the 
      previous word ends. For example, the word ``ac<U>m</U>'' can be followed 
      by the word ``<U>m</U>otorola''. Your task is to write a computer program 
      that will read the list of words and determine whether it is possible to 
      arrange all of the plates in a&nbsp;sequence (according to the given rule) 
      and consequently to open the door. 
      <H3>Input Specification</H3>The input consists of <VAR>T</VAR> test cases. 
      The number of them (<VAR>T</VAR>) is given on the first line of the input 
      file. Each test case begins with a line containing a&nbsp;single integer 
      number <VAR>N</VAR>that indicates the number of plates (<VAR>1 &lt;= N 
      &lt;= 100000</VAR>). Then exactly <VAR>N</VAR>lines follow, each 
      containing a&nbsp;single word. Each word contains at least two and at most 
      1000 lowercase characters, that means only letters '<CODE>a</CODE>' 
      through '<CODE>z</CODE>' will appear in the word. The same word may appear 
      several times in the list. 
      <H3>Output Specification</H3>Your program has to determine whether it is 
      possible to arrange all the plates in a&nbsp;sequence such that the first 
      letter of each word is equal to the last letter of the previous word. All 
      the plates from the list must be used, each exactly once. The words 
      mentioned several times must be used that number of times. 
      <P>If there exists such an ordering of plates, your program should print 
      the&nbsp;sentence "<CODE>Ordering is possible.</CODE>". Otherwise, output 
      the&nbsp;sentence "<CODE>The door cannot be opened.</CODE>".
