<H4>Input</H4>
<P>A text file consisting of a character followed by its Morse code 
representation as a series of '-' and '.', one character to a line. This data is 
terminated by a '@' in column 1. The code table is followed by an integer on a 
line by itself indicating the transmission speed in words-per-minute. This is 
followed by the message to be sent. For the purpose of transmission, end-of-line 
characters are _not_ to be sent. 
<H4>Output</H4>
<P>A copy of the message to be sent, one character per line followed by a 
listing, as integers of the number of milliseconds the transmitter will be on 
and the number of milliseconds the transmitter will be off to result in the 
desired speed. Each time is to be preceeded by at least one character of white 
space (space, tab or cr-lf) and followed by one character of white space. Sound 
times will be followed by a single character 'S' and no sound times will be 
followed by a single character 'N". The required inter character spacing will be 
the last entry in a line. Each line will be terminated by a new line character. 
<P>In determining the speed of transmission of messages in Morse code, the 
controlling element is the dot, '.'. The dash, '-', is three dots in length. 
Within a character the space between sounds is considered to be a dot in length. 
The inter-character space is at least a dash in length and the interword space 
in three dashes in length. It is assumed that each word is five characters in 
length. 
<P>For transmission speeds below thirteen (13) words-per-minute, the individual 
characters are formed using the dot length of thirteen words per minute, with 
the extra time placed between each character. Thus at 6.5 words per minute, the 
inter character space is twice (?) that of a 13 wpm transmission. 
<P>Above 13 wpm, both the character time and the inter character spacing are 
controlled by the speed. 
<P>For the purpose of this problem assume that the average character is eight 
(8) dots in length. Thus for a standard of 13 wpm transmission there would be 
65+13=78 characters per minute or 78*8=626 dot spaces per minute. You are to use 
this value for the basis of your program. 
<P>Below is a table of the characters which will be used for testing and their 
Morse Code representation. <PRE>A  .-		J  .---		S  ...		1  .----
