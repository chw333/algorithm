<P>Write a program that will keep track of the location of a dot on a piece of 
paper as it is being folded. 
<H4>Input</H4>
<P>The input file will contain 4 different types of records. 
<P><B>Type 1</B> will contain two real numbers separated by one space. These 
are, respectively, the width and height of the paper. 
<P><B>Type 2</B> will contain two real numbers and a character, all separated by 
one space. These numbers represent the coordinates of the dot on the paper. The 
first number is the distance horizontally from the upper left hand corner. The 
second is the distance down from the upper left hand corner. The character will 
tell you which side of the paper the dot is on (T for top, B for bottom). 
<P><B>Type 3</B> will contain two unseparated uppercase characters. The first 
character will tell you which of the four sides of the paper you are about to 
use (T for top, B for bottom, L for left, R for right). The second character 
will tell you whether to fold the paper over the top or under the bottom (O for 
over, U for under) e.g., TO, would mean you take the top of the paper and fold 
it over. Remember that the upper left hand corner is always 0, 0. 
<P><B>Type 4</B> will contain one uppercase 'S'. This will tell you to stop 
folding the paper. 
<H4>Output</H4>
<P>The output will consist of which piece of paper you are working on, the 
beginning size of the paper, the beginning location of the dot, the size of the 
paper and the location of the dot when you have finished folding the paper. 
<H4>Process</H4>This is best explained by an example. 
<P>Place a 8.5x11 paper on the desk in front of you. Place a dot on the top 
surface at 1.00 unit right of the top left corner and 2.00 units down from the 
top. Now, take the top edge of the paper and fold it over the top. The paper is 
now 8.5x5.5 and the dot is on the bottom of page 1. The location of the new 
position of the dot is 3.5 units from the top and 1.00 units to the right. Use 
these new 'coordinates' as the starting positions for the next set of folding 
instructions.

Paper number 2
Beginning paper dimensions 1.000000 X 2.000000
Dot is on TOP of page 1. Position: 0.550000 X 1.300000

After folding paper. Paper dimensions: 0.500000 X 2.000000
Dot is on TOP of page 2. Position 0.050000 X 3.300000
</PRE>
<P>Other Notes: 
<OL>
  <LI>The dot will never be on the edge of the paper or a fold line. 
  <LI>When folding the paper, pretend you are cutting the paper. In other words, 
  don't be concerned about the thickness of the fold. 
  <LI>All input characters will be in uppercase. </LI></OL><PRE></PRE></BODY></HTML>
