<P>Produce a table of the values of the series 
<P>
<CENTER><IMG 
src="Problem 4 - Numerical Summation of a Series.files/table1.gif"><BR>Equation 
1 </CENTER>
<P>for the 21 values of <I>x</I>, <I>x</I>= 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 2.0. All entries 
of the table must have a relative error less than 1.0e-10 (10 digits of 
precision). This problem is based on a problem from Hamming (1962), when 
mainframes were very slow by today's microcomputer standards. 
<H4>Input</H4>
<P>This problem has no input file. 
<H4>Output</H4>
<P>The output is to be written into a file "TABLE.OUT". The output is to be 
formatted as two columns with the values of <I>x</I> and <FONT 
face=Symbol>y</FONT>(<I>x</I>) printed as in the C printf or the Pascal writeln. 
<PRE>printf("%4.2f %16.12f\n", x, psix )		writeln(x:4:2, psix:16:2)
</PRE>
<P>As an example, here are 4 acceptable lines out of 21, which might appear in 
TABLE.OUT <PRE>0.00   1.644934066842
0.10   1.534607244899
...
1.00   1.000000000000
...
2.00   0.750000000002
</PRE>
<P>The values of <I>x</I> should start at 0.00 and increase by 0.1 until the 
line with <I>x</I>=2.00 is output. 
<H4>Process</H4>
<P>The problem with summing the sequence in equation 1 is that too many terms 
may be required to complete the summation in the given time. Additionally, if 
enough terms were to be summed, roundoff would render any typical double 
precision computation useless for the desired precision. 
<P>To improve the convergence of the summation process note that 
<CENTER><IMG 
src="Problem 4 - Numerical Summation of a Series.files/table2.gif"><BR>Equation 
2 </CENTER>
<P>which implies <FONT face=Symbol>y</FONT>(1)=1.0. One can then produce a 
series for <FONT face=Symbol>y</FONT>(<I>x</I>) - <FONT face=Symbol>y</FONT>(1) 
which converges faster than the original series. This series not only converges 
much faster, it also reduces roundoff loss. 
<P>This process of finding a faster converging series may be repeated again on 
the second series to produce a third sequence, which converges even more rapidly 
than the second. 
<P>The following equation is helpful in determing how may items are required in 
summing the series above.
