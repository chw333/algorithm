<H1>BOI'98 DAY 2 TASK 1</H1>
<H1>CONFERENCE CALL </H1>
<H2>PROBLEM</H2>
<P>A telecom company would like to offer a three-party conference call service. 
This service enables three customers to participate in a telephone conversation 
simultaneously. A customer accesses the interconnection network of the telephone 
system via a switch. The network consists of switches linked by bidirectional 
lines. Over the existing network, the three participants accessing the network 
via three different switches, must be connected with the minimum cost. Note that 
it is possible to connect any two switches. You will be given all the links 
between the switches of the network along with their associated costs. You are 
requested to find the connections which will minimize the total cost of 
interconnecting the three switches to which the participants in a conference 
call are connected. 
<H2>INPUT</H2>
<P>The input is a text file named conf.inp. The first line contains two numbers 
: The number of switches, designated by ( N &lt;= 100) and the number of 
switch-to-switch links in the network, designated by E, separated by a blank. 
Each of the following E input lines contains three integers, designated by i, j 
and c<SUB>i,j</SUB> where i and j are the numbers of two different switches and 
c<SUB>i,j</SUB>is the cost of using the link between i and j in a conference 
call (1 &lt;= c<SUB>i,j</SUB>&lt;= 100), each separated by one blank. The last 
line of input contains three integers, which designate the three switches that 
participate in the conference call, each separated by one blank. The switches 
are identified with integers 1 through N consecutively. 
<H2>OUTPUT</H2>
<P>The output must be a text file named conf.out. The first line must contain 
the total (minimal) cost of establishing a conference call among the given three 
switches and the number R of switch-to-switch connections needed to establish 
this conference call, separated by a blank. Each of the following R lines must 
contain two integers, which denote that the link between the switch numbered by 
the first integer and the switch numbered by the second integer is included in 
the solution -ordering of between the two switches is not important. The 
ordering among the last R lines of the output is also not important.
