<P align=left><BR><BR>A connected transmission is constructed by n (n&lt;=30) 
cylindrical units, labeled by 1,2,...,n in such a way that some pairs of units 
come to contact. If the units i and j contact and one of them is made going 
round in one of the two possible directions (Clockwise or Opposite), then the 
other begins to go round in the opposite direction. If a unit going round in one 
direction then the transmission blocks up. <BR><IMG height=148 
src="BOI 3-Day 2-Problem 3.files/323.gif" width=411><BR>You have to write a 
program which for a given transmission determines its behavior when a given unit 
i is made to go round in a given direction: blocks up or works normally. If the 
transmission works normally the program prints a list of units going round with 
the corresponding directions. Else the program has to determine the minimum 
number of units different from i to be removed from the blocked transmission so 
that all remaining units are going round when the unit i is made to go round.

      with the following format. The first line contains the number n of units 
      and the number m of contacting pairs of units. Each of the next m lines 
      contains two labels of pairs of contacting units. In the last line is 
      given the number i of a unit and one of the characters C or O defining the

      describes the behavior of the system in one letter: W (for "Works") or B 
      (for "Blocks"). If the system works then the second line is a list of 
      units rotating Clockwise, whereas the third line is a list of units 
      rotating Opposite direction after the removing is done and an additional 
      line of output is a list of Removed units. For the above example the
