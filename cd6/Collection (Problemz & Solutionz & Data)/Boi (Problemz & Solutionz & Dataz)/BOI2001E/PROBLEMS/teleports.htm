<h2>
Teleports</h2>

(Running time - 1s.)
<p><br>Great sorcerer Byter created two islands on the Baltic See: Bornholm
and Gotland. On each island he has installed some magical teleports. Each
teleport can work in one of two modes:
<ul>
<li>
receiving--one can be teleported to it,</li>

<li>
sending--anyone who enters the teleport is transfered to the specific destination
teleport on the other island, provided that the other teleport is in the
receiving mode.</li>
</ul>
Once, Byter gave his apprentices the following task: they must set the
teleports' modes in such a way, that no teleport is useless, i.e. for each
teleport set in the receiving mode there must be at least one teleport
sending to it, set in the sending mode; and vice versa, for each teleport
set in the sending mode, the destination teleport must be set in the receiving
mode.
<h2>
Task</h2>
Write a program that:
<ul>
<li>
reads the description of the teleports on both islands, form the input
file <tt>tel.in</tt>,</li>

<li>
determines the appropriate modes for teleports,</li>

<li>
writes the result to the output file <tt>tel.out</tt>.</li>
</ul>
If there are several possible solutions, your program should output just
one of them.
<h2>
Input</h2>
In the first line of the text file <tt>tel.in</tt>, there are two integers
<i>m</i> and <i>n</i>, <i>1&lt;=m,n&lt;=50 000</i>, separated by a single
space; <i>m</i> is the number of teleports on Bornholm, and <i>n</i> is
the number of teleports on Gotland. Teleports on both islands are numbered
from 1 to <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> respectively. The second line of the file
contains <i>m</i> positive integers, not greater than <i>n</i>, separated
by single spaces--<i>k</i>-th of these integers is the number of the teleport
on Gotland that is the destination of the teleport <i>k</i> on Bornholm.
The third line contains analogous data for teleports on Gotland, i.e. <i>n</i>
positive integers, not greater than <i>m</i>,separated by single spaces--<i>k</i>-th
of these integers is the number of the teleport on Bornholm that is the
destination of the teleport <i>k</i> on Gotland.
<h2>
Output</h2>
Your program should write two lines describing the modes of the teleports,
respectively, on Bornholm and Gotland, to the output file <tt>tel.out</tt>.
Both lines should contain a string of, respectively, <i>m</i> or <i>n</i>
ones and/or zeros. If the <i>k</i>-th character in the string is <tt>1</tt>,
then the <i>k</i>-th teleport is in the sending mode, and if it is <tt>0</tt>,
than the corresponding teleport is in the receiving mode.
