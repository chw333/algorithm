HE ARRIVED IN THE USA IN 1939 ON THE INVITATION OF JOHN VON NEUMAN AND
LIVED THERE EVER SINCE, AFFILIATED FIRST AT THE HARVARD UNIVERSITY AND THEN,
AFTER 1943, AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY. HIS CONTRIBUTIONS
BELONG TO VARIOUS AREAS OF MATHEMATICS AND LOGIC, IN SOME OF THEM, LIKE THE
THEORY OF MODELS, HE IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MAIN FOUNDERS. HIS NAME IS
ATTACHED TO NUMEROUS THEOREMS AND NOTIONS, THE MOST MOMENTOUS EVEN BEYOND
MATHEMATICS IS HIS GENERALLY ACCEPTED NOTION OF TRUTH.  TARSKI ESSENTIALLY
INFLUENCED THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONTEMPORARY LOGIC AND PHILOSOPHY, IN
PARTICULAR PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE.  HE INSISTED
VERY STRONGLY THAT LOGIC SHOULD HAVE AN INTERDISCIPLINARY CHARACTER AND FORM
A BRIDGE BETWEEN VARIOUS FIELDS. HE ALSO STRESSED THE SOCIAL ROLE OF LOGIC
--- IN HIS VIEW, LOGIC CONTRIBUTES TO FREEDOM AND THE RATIONAL LIFE.

IN CELEBRATION OF THE CENTENARY OF HIS BIRTH, THE TARSKI CENTENARY
CONFERENCE WILL FOCUS ON HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO LOGIC, THE FOUNDATIONS OF
MATHEMATICS, PHILOSOPHY, AS WELL AS ON THE CONTINUING INFLUENCE OF HIS WORK.
