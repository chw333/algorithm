      <P>Assume that we have a number of tasks that must be executed. However, 
      the tasks are not independent to each other. We say that task 2 depends on 
      task 1, if the execution of task2 can start after the completion of task 
      1.<BR>However, we may find tasks that at any given time can be executed in 
      parallel, saving time. Given a number of tasks and their dependencies, 
      determine the shortest time that all tasks can be executed in a computer 
      with an infinite number of processors. Then, you are requested to 
      determine the minimum number of processors in order to execute the tasks 
      in the (previously found) shortest time. Each task takes 1 time unit of 
      execution. The tasks are represented by positive integers from 1 to N 
      (N&lt;=200).</P>
      <P><B><FONT color=yellow>INPUT</FONT></B><BR>Your program should read the 
      input from the file INPUT.TXT as follows. The first line contains a 
      positive integer number N denoting the number of tasks to be executed in 
      the computer, and another positive integer number M, denoting the number 
      of dependencies. The next M lines until the end of the input file, contain 
      the dependencies between the tasks. For example, when the input line, 
      which corresponds to a dependency, contains the string "2 3", this means 
      that in order to start the execution of task 3, task 2 must be completed 
      first. Data is always correct and there is always a solution.</P>
      <P><B><FONT color=yellow>OUTPUT</FONT></B><BR>Your program should write 
      the output into the file OUTPUT.TXT as follows. The file has only one 
      line, which contains two positive integer numbers, separated by space 
      character. The first number T denotes the minimum number of time units 
      that we need in order to execute all tasks, assuming an infinite number of 
      processors. The second number denotes the minimum number of processors we 
      can use in order to execute the tasks in T time units.</P><B><FONT
