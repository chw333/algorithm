      <P>A man has escaped from prison, and trying to avoid the polie he enters 
      a square maze. The maze is composed of walking paths, doors and walls. 
      Each door connects two or more paths. The maze has only one entrance, 
      which is also the exit from the maze, and it is at the border of the 
      maze.<BR>The police, using a remote control device, can lock any door 
      inside the maze, except the entrance. Initially, all doors are unlocked. 
      The location of the running man into the maze is known, and it must be on 
      the path. The movement into the maze can have any direction, up, down, 
      left, right but no diagonal steps are allowed. Evidently, the running man 
      can not be on a closed door or on a wall.</P>
      <P>You are requested to help the police to trap the running man forever 
      into the maze. However, ONLY ONE DOOR must be locked, and this door must 
      be different than the entrance. The maximum size of the maze is 50 x 
      50.</P>
      <P><B><FONT color=yellow>INPUT</FONT></B><BR>Your program should read the 
      input from the file INPUT.TXT, which is an ASCII file. The first line 
      contains one positive integer number, denoting the side of the maze in 
      cells. The next line contains the location of the running man. Each 
      location is declared by a pair of numbers separated by a space character. 
      In each location the first number is the horizontal coordinate and the 
      second is the vertical coordinate. The numbering stars from the lower-left 
      corner of the maze (1,1). The following lines (until the end of the input 
      file) contain the description of the maze. The symbols are the following: 
      D denotes a door, E is the entrance/exit of the maze, P is a path and W 
      denots a wall, that no one can walk through. Any two symbols are separeted 
      by a space character.</P>
      <P><B><FONT color=yellow>OUTPUT</FONT></B><BR>Your program should produce 
      its output into the file OUTPUT.TXT as follows: The first line contains 
      the string "YES" if it is possible to trap the running man by locking only 
      one door, or "NO" otherwise. If the answer is YES, the next line contains 
      an integer denoting how many doors qualify. The rest of the file contains 
      the locations of the doors (one location per line) that if any of them is 
      locked, then the running man can not escape the maze.</P><B><FONT
