<H2 align=center>Day 2 - Problem 1 (Waiting for a ticket)</H2>
<P align=center><BR><BR>The U2 rock group will give a concert in Nicosia during 
November 96. A queue of n&lt;=200 U2-fans waiting to buy a ticket from a single 
cashier has been formed. Each person wants to buy only one ticket, whereas the 
cashier can sell at most two tickets to a person. <BR><BR>Suppose that the 
cashier spends ti time units to serve the i-th fan (where 1 &lt;= i &lt;= n). 
However, two consecutive fans in the queue (e.g. the j-th and the (j+1)-th one 
(1 &lt;= j &lt;= n-1) may agree so that one of them remains in the queue and the 
other leaves the queue, if the time rj required by the cashier to serve the j-th 
and the (j+1)-th fan is smaller than t<SUB>j</SUB> + t<SUB>j+1</SUB>. Thus, in 
order to minimize the cashier's time and prevent the U2-fans from being 
squeezed, each person in the queue tries to negotiate with his predecessor and 
his successor, and finally speed up the process. <BR><BR>Given positive integer 
values for n, t<SUB>i</SUB> and r<SUB>j</SUB>, minimize the total cashier's 
time. This is achieved by making pairs of consecutive persons in an optimal way. 
Note, however, that it is not necessary for a specific fan to be paired with a 
predecessor or a successor. <BR><BR><BR></P>

      number i, if the i-th fan is served alone, or i+(i+1) if these two fans
