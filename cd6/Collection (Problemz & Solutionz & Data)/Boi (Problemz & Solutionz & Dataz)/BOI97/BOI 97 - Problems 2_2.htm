      <P>Assume we have a network of computers, where each computer is connected 
      with others by means of cables. Each cable connects exactly two computers, 
      and two computers can be connected to each other by only one cable. Given 
      a network of computers you are requested to determine all the cables that 
      participate in a cycle. Also, for each cable you must determine the number 
      of cycles in which this cable participates. A cycle is a sequence of 
      cables, starting from computer A and leading to itself. However, each 
      computer, other than A, in the cycle, should participate only once.</P>
      <P><B><FONT color=yellow>INPUT</FONT></B><BR>Your program should read the 
      input from the file INPUT.TXT as follows. The first line contains a 
      positive integer number N (N&lt;=20) denoting the number of computers in 
      the network. The next N lines describe the computer connections in a 
      matrix form. Thus, each line has N elements, separated by a space 
      character. If an entry in line L and column C is 0, this means that there 
      is no direct connection between computers L and C. Otherwise there is a 
      direct connection between them.</P>
      <P><B><FONT color=yellow>OUTPUT</FONT></B><BR>Your program should write 
      the output into the file OUTPUT.TXT as follows. The first line contains a 
      positive integer denoting the number M of cables that participate in at 
      least one cycle. Then, one line follows, containing a sequence of M 
      positive integer numbers (separated by a space character) representing the 
      number of cycles that each cable participates in. This sequence must be 
      sorted in increasing order. If there is no cable that participates in 
      cycle(s), the output file should contain a single line with the string "NO 
      CYCLE".</P><B><FONT color=yellow>EXAMPLE 1</FONT></B>
